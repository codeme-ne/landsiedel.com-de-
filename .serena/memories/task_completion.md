- Ensure changes follow PEP 8, include helpful docstrings/type hints, and avoid new hardcoded paths.
- Run `pytest -q` (or focused tests) before delivering if changes affect behavior.
- Provide output diffs under output/ when relevant and document translation results.
- Adhere to Conventional Commit messages (e.g., `feat(parser): ...`) when committing.
- Keep tool offline-first; do not add external service dependencies or expose secrets/configs.
