<h1>The future of the NLP is yellow</h1>
<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>The NLP of the future will be individually tailored to the user and context variables will take much more into account than the previous standard interventions of psychology. Standard formats are used to learn and discover the basics. After that, users learn <a href="/en/was-ist-nlp.html" title="What is NLP?">NLP</a> to tailor their lives and their lives. As a result, NLP will develop an even greater appeal for growth and development-oriented people. The application of NLP in the various areas such as school, kindergartens, health care, professional life is much further elaborated. The scepticism of science and politics must be overcome. A more consistent use of modeling strategies opens up many more specific fields of application. NLP becomes a companion of the integral lifestyle. Individually tailored mini-interventions help each of us to live more of our potential: personality development, maintenance and optimization of our own health, communication improvement, achievement of goals and more. If a critical threshold is exceeded and even more coaches, coaches and users are also publicly committed to NLP, we will see how it spreads rapidly, meets large crowds and finally find a spread from which we can only dream today. Then "NLP for all!" becomes possible.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article describes where I see the future of NLP. I also want to reposition NLP. Previously, NLP was a tool case full of methods for optimizing communication and an effective coaching and therapy tool.</p>
<p>For me, NLP is above all a method of personal development of each individual person. It contributes to the fact that more and more people are enlightened in their way and can realize their best potential in the sense of the integral model and contribute to the welfare of humanity.</p>
<p>This is about integrating NLP into his own life and developing as a human being. My goal is to animate people to activate their full potential for the good of all and the planet.</p>
<h2>My background</h2>
<p>Als ich in den neunziger Jahren die NLP-Szene betrat, war NLP ein hocheffektives therapeutisches Werkzeug. 1995 besuchte ich meine  <a href="/en/nlp-practitioner.html" title="NLP-Practitioner Training">NLP-Practitioner Training</a> in Landau in the Palatinate. This was led by two clinical psychologists. I was at the beginning of 20. The next youngest participant was 35 years old and still studied psychology. Many of the other participants were experienced psychotherapists. Everywhere, they heard and read the sentence: "NLP was born when one modeled the best therapists of her time at her work."</p>
<p>In doing so, I personally first came from a rather related but nevertheless somewhat different direction. I had started to deal with the theories of Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler and then Carl Gustav Jung. Young fascinated me most and here in particular the approach of the individual. Individuation means the process of becoming, finding and developing one's own uniqueness. I read with enthusiasm the books of Hermann Hesse: Siddhartha, the steppeswolf and many others. It was the way to me and the search for a very personal sense of life. I felt that the deepest of all mysteries was hidden within ourselves. There was something in me that wanted to go out into the world. The idea that there was a reason I was born into this world - a task - a quest - a reputation. At that time, I wrote in my diary: "From today, I'll take my parents up and take my education."</p>
<p>At that time some thought games began in my head. I gathered the heads of state and religion in a room and let them discuss how to turn this world into paradise. I suspected that this must be a common goal of all those present. It quickly became clear to me that it is not possible if various religions (including the Christianity of my childhood) claimed that they and only they had found the one true way. Suddenly, someone like the Dalai Lama was very sympathetic to me because he said, "The heart of all religions is one." And I understood him that the similarities in the center of teachings are much more important than the differences in the margins expressed in different rituals, customs, books and stories.</p>
<p>After the Abitur, I had the luck to make 15 months of civil service as one of the last years. I used old dying people and cared for disabled children. Whenever I had night shift and nothing was going on, I read psychology books. It fascinated me how we treat people so differently with the various challenges of life. I saw old dying people who complained about everything that whispered and screamed all day. But then there were also people like Mrs Bludra who was already 100 years old and who enjoyed life every day. When we brought her food, she often told us civilian servants stories from their long, exciting and filled lives. She knew she had lived! She had done everything she had to do. Had taken life to the fullest, and now just enjoyed every day that was given to her, full of joy.</p>
<p>Also in the disabled children I could discover amazing things. Some of them were happier than the healthy children. They rejoiced every day, took the moments they came. How could that be? Why could children who seem to have had everything be more unhappy than disabled children who were severely restricted? The answer had to be somewhere in us – in our thoughts and attitudes.</p>
<p>When I started studying psychology, I rushed with great zeal to everything I could experience. I also read everything I could experience in the library about NLP and other approaches. I studied the great wisdom teachers and the motivation coaches. I started my day with affirmations and ended with target visualizations. I lived on 9m2 for five years and spent some of the best years of my life reading, studying and trying.</p>
<p>There were 123 students living in my home and there was at least one every day who had any subject I could have helped him. I could easily pick up my "victims" in the hallways and in the common areas of the dormitory and then take off on my couch. Most of the time, there were no therapeutic cases, but students who were just facing some challenges of life: love grief, fear for exams, diarrhea or a lecture that was to be held.</p>
<h2>NLP for healthy</h2>
<p>Then I first experienced <a href="/en/wichtige-personen/tony-robbins.html" title="Anthony Robbins">Tony Robbins</a> at a seminar. I was electrified. Tony used NLP in pure culture, but his goal was less to make therapy, but to enable ordinary people to achieve maximum performance, and this awakened the enthusiasm in me. I could identify myself with that.</p>
<p>In 1998 my first book "<!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp/buch-vorstellung.html" title="Way up den eigenen Traum leben">-->Way up <!--</a>-->den eigenen Traum leben" erschien, war ich gerade in meiner  <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp/nlp-trainer.html" title="NLP Trainer Ausbildung">-->
NLP Training<!--</a>-->. Some of the participants read the book and their feedback was overwhelming. You wouldn't have known that you could use NLP so positively for healthy people. Until then, NLP had been more of a form of therapy that could be used for self-therapy at best. From then on, NLP was for me: "Psychology for Healthy".</p>
<h2>NLP in der Selbstanwendung</h2>
<p>I began to use more and more NLP with myself. When I then read the works of Robert Dilts on the so-called <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/practitioner/p-09-01-die-neurologischen-ebenen.html" title="Neurologische Ebenen">-->Neurological levels<!--</a>--> got to know, it was clear: NLP is a tool to shape his own life. A help to become the person I and everyone else would like to be. In the model of Dilts, besides the levels previously well known in the NLP, behavior and skills (strategy) are primarily about the higher levels of beliefs/values, identity and spirituality/ vision/ belonging. The work on these levels was quite enthusiastic about me. I began to imagine who I would like to be and designed a picture of the personality I dreamed of.</p>
<p>I developed a morning program for me in which I set up exercises that trained my mind, brought me into contact with my visions and allowed me to work regularly on myself and my shadow sides. This included both <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/meditation.html" title="Meditation">--><u>Meditation</u><!--</a>--> as well as movement and training. For years, as a student, I stood up every morning at 5:45, at a time when most students still sleep. In doing so, I have become aware of how much we can change and develop specifically if we are prepared to complete the necessary training for this. I only realized a lot later that many people get to know NLP in a seminar, but don't really use it in their lives.</p>
<p>Damit meine ich, dass sie eine Technik in einem Seminar lernen, diese dann vielleicht auch ein oder zweimal in einer  <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-peergruppen/" title="NLP Übungsgruppe">-->
Peer group<!--</a>--> or practice with someone from the circle of friends, but only very rare and almost not with themselves. NLP works and shows excellent effects when you use it regularly. Many use it more than a crisis intervention tool. It's good that you can do of course. But my concern is to spread NLP as something that helps people make the best of themselves – to lead a life according to their own ideas. This does not mean the same for everyone. On the contrary, there are great differences!</p>
<h2>Das Modell von Graves in Verbindung mit NLP</h2>
<p>In 1998 I first learned something about <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/m-08-02-graves-wertemodell.html" title="Graves Modell">-->Graves Levels <!--</a>-->of American College Professor Clare Graves. But I walked out
by. Apparently, I didn't realize what potential this model was. Only a few years later when I met the model again in a different context, it grabbed me and since then became the extensions of <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/ken-wilber.html" title="Ken Wilber">--><u>Ken Wilber</u><!--</a>--> and Don Beck to my favorite model. This model describes the development of man and his values. Depending on where we are in our development, we have different values. It thus provides a number of explanations why people think differently and act why they seek different goals and why they think something good or evil.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is a development model and describes as such in which sequence a natural development takes place, which needs appear first and which then. NLP can help us, as a model in which change is concerned, to contribute positively to development at almost all levels. While development levels are described in the Graves model and we now know where we stand and what thinking we are currently dominating, NLP describes how this WAS can be changed. The two approaches complement each other excellently.</p>
<p>The development in recent years, which can be traced by the Graves Levels, has also been carried out in parallel in the NLP world. With increasing development of society, NLP has become more and more a tool for the higher Graves levels. When many NLP followers were initially interested in using NLP as a method of success in order to make themselves more efficient and successful (orange), more and more people came to the green level of development via NLP, which is about humanistic values. Many people did well to learn appreciation for their own individual life views. Then more and more systemic thoughts came into the world. System setups shot like mushrooms out of the ground and more and more the realization prevailed that it would be important to take into account the respective system during changes. This led to yellow thinking on the horizon.</p>
<p>I suspect that in the last two decades we have experienced such a stormy development, because people who are regularly undergoing and attending seminars are also the people who can get the most access to the higher levels of development - at least in terms of cognitive understanding of this level. Trainers and coaches usually go to many seminars, they read relatively many books and magazines to learn more recent developments. Perhaps they are most willing to try new ways.</p>
<h2>Short introduction to the model of Graves</h2>
<p>A well-founded introduction to the Graves model far exceeds the scope of these statements. Interested parties are referred to my other publications on this subject. Here I would just like to describe the model very closely.</p>
<p>The Graves model is shown as a spiral to make it clear that the development is gradually unfolding and open up. Both the individual and the humanity gradually passes through these phases. Of course, some people are still standing at one stage and no longer develop. Some also fall back to a previous stage. Each stage of development corresponds to environmental factors. It needs certain conditions, e.g. peace, law and law, stability etc., so that a certain stage of development can be achieved and lived.</p>
<p>At the first stage (AN, Beige), as on the need pyramid of Abraham Maslow, there are also existential basic needs. It's about food, water, heat and sexuality. Man is driven by instincts and genetic factors. His goal is survival.</p>
<p>At the second stage (BO, Purpur), the merger of larger associations in the form of tribes succeeds in obtaining more security. The tribes offer protection against other tribes or other dangers. Rituals and first forms of cause-effect thinking arise. They are believed to be natural gods everywhere and strive to live in harmony with them. The individual must subordinate himself to the principles of the tribe. Saying has the council of elders or the Shaman who proclaims the will of the gods.</p>
<p>At the third stage (CP, red) a strong ego consciousness awakens. It is about power and fulfilling your own needs also at the expense of others. If necessary, aggression is used. All nations are covered with war and committed to their own civilization. At individual level, people do everything to satisfy their own needs. They are powerful, impulsive and heroic.</p>
<p>The third level develops into the fourth level (DQ, blue). This level is about laws and principles. The red rule of violence is imposed by a clear social order. The first mono-religions are created that want to give people morality and laws for a good life. Who is at this level, learns to restore impulsiveness and now do something that only bears fruit later. Many put themselves in the service of a higher thing and do in their place what has to be done. The blue order creates in our time education, police, military, logistics, quality management.</p>
<p>At the fifth level (ER, Orange) it is about to move forward. Natural sciences enable people to make amazing advances in technology. The principles of the economy allow for an enormous convulsion. It is about strategically and enabling progress. At the individual level, orange shows itself in our performance thinking, but also in a materialistic attitude. They try to stand out from other brands and property.</p>
<p>At the sixth level (FS, Green), the human being refers to the fundamental values for friends, people, dialogue and relationships. The humanistic idea arises that all people are the same and are valuable in their individual nature. There are different opinions, but they should all be heard and included in the solution finding.</p>
<p>After these six levels, a kind of quantum leap takes place. So far, every level of development believes that their views are the only right ones. Only from the next level is it possible to integrate the strengths of the individual planes with one another and to resort to them as required. The next level (GT, Yellow) is necessary because we cannot solve the current problems of the planet by ourselves with the earlier levels. We need many people who make themselves the thinking, skills and skills of the yellow level to solve the challenges.</p>
<h2>Description of the yellow plane</h2>
<p>On the yellow level, we recognise that there are many different angles to reality that everyone can contribute. Each perspective reveals a certain aspect to us and makes other aspects come into the background. In the integral theory, we also talk about each perspective being true, but only partially.</p>
<p>This is particularly beautifully illustrated by one of my favorite stories. Four blinds should describe an elephant. The first blind touches the elephant on his leg and says, "The elephant is round and is firmly in the earth." The second blind touches the elephant on the abdomen, the third on his bumper and the fourth on the trunk. They all have a different angle of view and consider their true. They all have partial right, but not quite.</p>
<p>The story is very often told in the NLP context to illustrate that each of us has its individual model of reality that differs from the model of others. The basis for our model is our experience due to our senses. In doing so, our perception is subject to numerous filter mechanisms, which only allow certain content to enter into our conscious awareness.</p>
<h2>The map is not the area</h2>
<p>Already in 1938, Alfred Korzybski formulated the phrase in neurolinguistic training: "The map is not the area," which has since learned generations of NLPlers in their trainings. Everyone
of us has created his own model of the world and thinks and acts as part of this model. NLP helps us get the flexibility to realize a "thinking outside the box" by recognizing and overcoming the boundaries of our own model. If we remember this thought, we can see very many truths as partial truths that are valid for certain areas, but not universal. With a very large overview we manage to create models that allow us to classify the other models. Like Ken Wilber with his 4-quadrant model and the <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/integrales-denken.html#aqal" title="AQAL">-->AQAL theory<!--</a>--> did. Such a model ends the discussions which model is better or worse because it explains within what scope of validity what approach is to be given. A great learning step in human evolution.</p>
<p>In the development model of Clare Graves, the yellow level leads the second rank (English 2nd Tier). It is the first level where people can appreciate and appreciate the different previous levels. From the yellow stage of development there is a comprehensive understanding of the concerns, but also special skills of the previous levels. It is now necessary to balance this level with one another; to use the strengths and to ensure that the unhealthy side of a development level (e.g. national socialism, crusades) does not appear to be too strong.</p>
<p>On the yellow level, however, we also recognize that not all angles of view are equally valuable in every context. Some are more true and deeper than others. The "green flatland" is lifted, which usually does not like people at the green development stage. After all, everyone is in green! Anyone who could presume (even if it is limited to a specific context or scope) to claim that his perspective is more important or better than another. This is the famous phrase: "If green looks yellow, then green looks red!" Green overlooks the fact that it imposes its own position on others, namely that everything is the same.</p>
<p>Green wants to treat all people equally. This simplifies a complex situation. Let us imagine for a moment that the United States would treat all the countries of Europe equally, because from their perspective they are all equal to each other. This means that Italy, Greece, Germany and the United Kingdom would each be treated equally without respecting the peculiarities of these countries.</p>
<p>Recently in a seminar I met a realization like the flash. The speaker told about the golden rule: "Tell others as you would like to be treated by them." How many times I tried and failed. At once, I realized that the sentence must be re-formulated: "Tell others as they want to be treated." We are different and we do not want to be treated equally. (In the integral theory according to Ken Wilber there is therefore, in addition to the distinction according to the stage of development, also the distinction in types.)</p>
<h2>Holarchy</h2>
<p>On yellow we recognize that earlier levels are enclosed by newer, more complex levels. It's called holarchy. The previous stage of development is included, but it goes beyond that. This is often made clear in the following example: an atom consists, inter alia, of several electrons. A cell consists of several atoms. An organism consists of very many cells, etc. Or using the example of brain development: The oldest brain is the stem brain. Then the Limbic system developed over it and above it the Neocortex. In each development step, the underlying planes are enclosed and a new and more complex layer is created.</p>
<p>A view that includes the entire ecosystem is deeper than a view that only takes into account its own people. While an ethnocentric view has more depth than an egocentric view.</p>
<p>Each stage of development is important and will always appear on this planet. This is the natural course of evolution. Therefore, every level deserves attention and care. Yellow tries to make a balance of these world views. Yellow is therefore also often called Spiral Wizzards, which freely translates spiral magic. This world view thus encompasses depth and width. Yellow wants to take more comprehensive and more complex perspectives to see and better deal with complex interconnected systems. The term "systems" refers to a variety of types of systems such as relationships or global organisations.</p>
<p>Through this systemically connected complex thinking, Yellow achieves a major developmental advantage that enables it to find more creative solutions.</p>
<p>Some also describe the leap to yellow as a quantum leap of humanity. Now it's not just about lacking needs but being needs. Man can draw from the fullness on this level. Problems are becoming creative challenges and solutions are being sought in which nobody gets hurt and wins as much as possible all (Win-Win principle).</p>
<p>Who has reached this level can enjoy the wonders of the world and lives responsibly as well as authentically as the person he or she is. He has a healthy self-relatedness and at the same time takes part in the well-being of people.</p>
<p>When Graves first encountered yellow in his investigations, he had the impression that these people were dealing with problems quite differently than those he had studied so far. They found much faster and more creative solutions that often ensured that the problem could not occur again in the future. In line with this, Einstein has formulated something that I regain from memory: "One cannot solve problems with the thinking that created these problems. You need a new way of thinking."</p>
<p>That's exactly what the yellows can do. They are the spearhead of humanity on the way to an integral consciousness. NLP can help us to develop the yellow level of consciousness within us in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2>The yellow NLPler: How can NLP help develop the yellow level of consciousness?</h2>
<p>For me, NLP is the means of choice for people who are at this level. With NLP, problems and challenges can be tackled creatively. Formats are not used as rigid structures which must be maintained step by step in the blue sense. Rather, they serve as a framework of action within which changes can be created.</p>
<p>The classic NLP basic topic <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/practitioner/p-01-03-rapport-pacing-und-leading.html" title="Rapport, Pacing und Leading">-->Rapport<!--</a>--> is about building a relationship with another person or group. In doing so, the NLP user thinks into the world model of the other person and uses his body to feel what the other person is feeling by mirroring. Who is often practiced in this way not only his <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/coaching-welt/wissen/lexikon/empathie.html" title="Empathie" target="_blank">-->Empathy<!--</a>-->- Developing skills and feeling more and more frequently what others feel, but also expanding their own thinking and thus world model. It increases its flexibility and social competence in dealing with individual and groups. He also learns to focus on the needs, feelings and wishes of others.</p>
<p>The <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/practitioner/p-09-02-wahrnehmungspositionen-1-2-3.html" title="Wahrnehmungspositionen">-->Method of perception positions<!--</a>-->, in which I can look at a conflict or a situation from several perspectives, is a very good training tool to expand my own position. Here, people learn systematically to establish their own position, then that of the opposite and that of an outsider. By reflection on <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/coaching-welt/wissen/lexikon/metaebene.html" title="Metaebene">-->Meta level<!--</a>--> to identify where there is still something missing and how the three positions can be integrated. Of course, it takes a certain cognitive development to be able to perform this format in a meaningful way. But if there is a willingness to be able to put itself fully into opposing positions with curiosity and goodwill, then this method is a revelation and a serious training to come out of the petty self-thinking and to realize what is necessary systemically for the benefit of many.</p>
<p>A similar objective is also pursued by <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/m-02-08-einen-neuen-glauben-generieren.html" title="NLP Mentoren Modell">-->NLP mentor technique<!--</a>-->. Here, the lead seeks at least three mentors, from which he wants to learn or learn something about a current life problem. He describes his problem, places himself on the place of the respective mentor, moves so well into it and speaks from its perspective and with its wisdom. It's really unbelievable what new aspects come up with and how that can change the view of the problem. Its own horizon expands, the ability to solve problems increases dramatically, as if the person now had access to a completely different quality of information that was previously unavailable.</p>
<p>It also helps <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/m-09-00-diamond-technik.html" title="Diamond-Technik">-->Diamond technique<!--</a>-->. There are numerous angles and points of view on a goal, a set of beliefs, a problem or another matter. Starting from one sentence, an opposition is developed and checked. Then the common in the both-as-also discovered and still a new perspective is added. This simple Diamond is enhanced by a whole network of Diamonds, creating complex new visions. The current problem can be seen as a solution for a previous problem. The current solution is the basis for a problem of the future, etc. A sophisticated technique in which the concept of right and wrong gradually dissolves. We realize everything has its meaning, it depends on where I want to use it.</p>
<p>The <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-e-mail-training/lektionen/nlp-e-mail-training-47.html" title="Ökologie-Check">-->
Ecology check<!--</a>--> is an NLP basic technology. It is carried out at the beginning or end of almost any NLP change work. The question is what the positive or negative consequences of a certain change would be. The impact of a change on the systems surrounding the individual would have. This can be both the own internal system and the family system, the enterprise system or even the entire society. Making this question systematically and regularly in every process of change, raises awareness about systemic consequences. Through the ecology check, we realize that we are also part of something bigger in the sense of holarchy. In this way, we can become more aware of the connection with the requirements and needs of the larger system around us and put our own petty and selfish needs back. If a team in a large organization does not see itself as part of the whole organization, it will be as good as it is in the sense of the team, but may not keep in mind the interests of the organization. The team will not be loyal and will not involve the overall design in the considerations.</p>
<p>Let's go on a plane. If the organization sees itself as a measure of all things and does not understand itself as part of a larger system, it can do things that hurt society very much and at the same time see only its own advantage, e.g. environmental regulations, as recently happened in the exhaust gas scandal of VW. An organization that is aware of its connection and responsibility to the larger system surrounding it and sees itself as part of it will not come up with the idea of harming itself in this way. It's like poisoning yourself.</p>
<p>If mankind does not grasp itself as part of the entire ecosystem, it will destroy what is an important part of its habitat. Each element should always be aware that it is both a whole (holon) and a part of something even bigger. The frequent practice of these techniques leads to the fact that we can increasingly incorporate alternative views in our everyday thinking and not just strive for our own individual advantage. We then realize, for example, that while meat tastes good as an individual, we should stop or reduce our consumption of meat for the benefit of the planet. If we recognize a greater connection, we want to make much more of our contribution to the sustainable and ecological way of dealing with our resources, so that our descendants also enjoy this ingenious nature and remain in equilibrium with the habitat of today's animal and plant world.</p>
<p>In this way our boundaries shift in our thinking. Most people would probably say that their body is their limit. From professionals we sometimes hear that they merge with an object, such as a rider and his horse or a golfer becomes a unit with his racket and perhaps with the ball. In a tantric union ritual, man and woman merge and suddenly take as one. It's like there's a field around us that we can extend.</p>
<p>This happens in the NLP very regularly in <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/m-05-00-core-transformation.html" title="Core-Transformation">-->Core transformation<!--</a>-->. Here many pupils reach a state by being connected to the world in a deep way. The core state is expressed in various ways. But for many it is like a connection with a greater wisdom. An immersion in wholeness, love, okay being. We have the feeling to connect to the bigger one. Some climbers formulate this as a summit experience. The view into the vastness when one has declared a summit, suddenly one becomes one with the mountain, nature or whatever is around one. I believe that experiencing this feeling is essential in order to deal with his surroundings in love and wisdom. NLP brings us into this summit experience with precise directions.</p>
<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p>Flexibility is an important basis in the NLP. "If what you do not work, then do something else" is one of the most common quotes in an NLP training. We often rely on Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety.</p>
<p>The NLP techniques and models train their own behavioral flexibility in great variety. Many people tend to follow the tracks that are constantly in motion and to tackle problems in the same way. They do not make it possible to change their approach, even if it has not repeatedly led to the desired result. That is very regrettable.</p>
<h2>Modeling and new knowledge</h2>
<p>NLP was created by modeling excellent therapists. Modelling is about learning from other people, finding out what characterizes them in a certain way and then transferring these qualities, so that other people or the model themselves can benefit from this through the conscious rail.</p>
<p>Yellow loves to include and integrate new knowledge. NLP has hardly received and integrated new knowledge for many years. There is a lot to discover here. Most of the models are still based on the analyses of the first years, which were mainly related to the outstanding therapists Fritz Perls, Virginia Satir and Milton H. Erickson. In the meantime, the world has turned on. Great new approaches to human change have been developed.</p>
<p>Many of these approaches - although they come out of the NLP and/or were developed by NLP authors - were published under their own name and become well-known brands in the seminar and psychotherapy scene. For example, I count EMDR, Wing Wave, Magic Words.</p>
<p>One of the co-founders of the NLP, <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp/wichtige-personen/richard-bandler.html" title="Richard Bandler">-->Richard Bandler<!--</a>-->, has later released new concepts under new brand names and have been legally protected, e.g. Design Human Engineering, Neurosonics, Neuro Hpnotic Repatterning.</p>
<p>This overlooks a little that NLP is already a meta approach that can describe changes in a variety of ways. The NLP map offers a large space to map numerous other approaches to change here.</p>
<p>A first idea of what is meant here is that <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/coaching-bibliothek/weitere-methoden/soar-modell.html" title="SOAR-Modell">-->SOAR model<!--</a>--> in. Here, the dimensions of time (the past, present, future), perception positions (1,2,3) and the planes of Dilts are combined with one another to form a three-dimensional structure in which each NLP transformation process can be imaged as a way through the space. At the same time, the experienced user recognizes the ways that have not yet been implemented in change techniques and can thus develop new formats and change strategies themselves.</p>
<p>NLP has developed excellent approaches to get knowledge out of experts, even if their knowledge is not really aware of them. From the fullness of the approaches, I just want to <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/practitioner/p-04-00-meta-modell.html" title="Meta-Modell">-->Meta model<!--</a>--> of the language. This is a variety of questions that make it possible to question knowledge very profoundly and to transform the material we offer as a surface structure in a statement by the expert back to the originally underlying depth structure. Asking good questions is an important ability to discover patterns and to make them available to the general public later.</p>
<h2>NLP in everyday life<br/>
How can we use NLP for ourselves every day?</h2>
<p>NLP is so diverse that it can help us in countless situations every day. Here are some examples:<br/>
I wake up and focus my focus immediately on positive states of feeling. I use focus questions, visualizations, anchors and perhaps my inner voice, which is polished with the help of the submodalities. As soon as I stand, I change my physiology to put me in a mood that makes sense for the day. Then I go with open senses into first communication with my partner or my children. I build rapport, calibrate on it and possibly use meta-model question techniques to get their plans and wishes to know for the day. It can be that I already flexibly reframe first answers here in order to further communicate constructively.</p>
<p>Then I'll go to work. I shape the work path with positive anchors, such as beautiful music, or then pictures on the workplace. When there is a conversation with another person, I will briefly put myself in this person, as in the process 1-2-3-meta. Maybe I also hear the voice of my mentor who gives me advice.</p>
<p>Once a situation excites me, I begin to dissociate myself and change my condition. I set clear solutions for the day or the task ahead. In dealing with my business partners, customers or children, I use hypnotic language patterns to give them the freedom to fill the open places with their ideas.</p>
<p>If I experience something special, I'll be amazed. In conversations with other people I ask them helpful and targeted questions. I give them high attention and sensitivity. I look at her <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/practitioner/p-02-00-repraesentationssysteme.html" title="Wahrnehmungskanal">-->Perception channel<!--</a>--> and on their <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/m-06-00-meta-programme.html" title="Meta-Programme">-->Meta programs<!--</a>-->. I hear their restrictive <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/m-02-00-glaubenssaetze.html" title="Glaubenssätze">-->Principles<!--</a>-->  heraus und biete ihnen Alternativen an ... usw.</p>
<p>Basically, all day offers me opportunities to use NLP methods.</p>
<h2>NLP in verschiedenen Kontexten</h2>
<p>Many participants in an NLP training or an NLP seminar find it difficult to use the mediated in new contexts. They cannot easily be abstracted and new fields of application can be obtained. Some time ago, an NLP trainer contacted my one-day seminar “Sales with NLP”. Since I knew him, I called him and told him that he would definitely not get to know anything new as an NLP trainer in a one-day seminar on which complete NLP starters also take part. I called him all the themes to go. He insisted that he wanted to participate and so I did not deny his wish. I conducted my seminar as I always did. In the end, he came to me enthusiastically and thanked me overwhelmingly. At the first moment I thought he wanted to take me on his arm. But then we talked about details. It turned out that he had not seen many application references in his previous NLP training. For the first time, he learned how to use the 5-4-3-2-1 method to initiate a trance in a sales talk. Also, he hadn't been aware that immigrant treatment is virtually reframing, and he just had to think about any objection from his customers. The idea of using the different types of VAKOG in its sales documents and, if necessary, addressing all types in a sales presentation was not yet familiar to him. He realized that in a conversation he could also ensue with his voice and not only by touching. The meta-model of the language he had previously known as a complex therapeutic question instrument was now a method for breaking boundaries in the buyer's world model. The Future-Pace has become an effective remedy for repentance, etc.</p>
<p>As a result, I've seen something like that again and again. Finally, in a seminar I took more and more time to ensure this kind of context transfer among my participants. I didn't let it go through when someone said nice format, but on my work I can't use it. This is exactly what a participant said about the 6-step reframing, a really very classic NLP method. I replied that, of course, he could not use it that way. Communication with inner parts, which would then possibly be small green males that would make it comfortable on their own hands, would of course not be an adequate form of expression. But how would it be to explain the structure underlying the format with appropriate words and then I described it a 6-step as to how to carry out it in any kind of conversation, e.g. an employee interview. That sounds like this: "So, Mr Meier, you are facing the problem X. Do you have an idea of what is responsible for it coming so far?" Answer. Then the next question: "Is it a positive reason why this problem has arisen?" Answer. "Do you see creative ways to achieve this differently in the future?" Answer. "What of these possibilities is best suited to them?" Answer. "Just try it out in the next few weeks. What do you think? Answer. "Do you see anything else that speaks about it?" Answer. "Well, when is it going? What exactly are you going to do first?"</p>
<p>This is, of course, just a way to get out without the terms "go in trance", "no contact to your part", "quest your creative part", "let you give a signal from your unconscious" etc.</p>
<p>A few years later, I met the CP3 structure in a master trainer training at Bert Feustel and Wyatt Woodsmall. My curiosity was aroused, because here it is about how to store topics for themselves and then teach that participants can transfer from one methodology to another context. There are numerous possible procedures for each NLP format. These are step by step instructions on how to make a format. First is to do... second is to do... etc. This is like a concrete directing instruction - like a kind of exact cooking recipe. Such a description is very good to follow it exactly as well as to achieve good results very quickly as a beginner. However, if knowledge and skills remain at this level, then the user cannot apply the learned in another situation. To be able to do this, he must know at the level about it. This level is what we call the process. He must know what structure the process is based on. Such a structure does not describe a clear process, but the essence of the procedure. While it is described in the procedure, for example, that when anchoring, the left hand is placed on the client's knee in order to core a negative anchor there. Would only stand in the process that the negative anchor should be set. Whether this is done by a word, an image or a touch would then still be open. Sometimes, in the seminar, I have several procedures for one and the same process to make it clear to the participants that as soon as they have understood the underlying process, they can actually carry out them in any number of ways.</p>
<p>Participants who have learned a technique from their trainers at the procedural level suddenly face insurmountable obstacles when there is only a small deviation. This could be if anchoring on the client's knee is not possible or not desired. At once they begin to row because they are not clear that they could put the anchor differently.</p>
<p>I would like to say that <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/rhetorik/metapher.html" title="Metaphern">-->Metapher<!--</a>--> who once told me Klaus Grochowiak, where I did the NLP training. The story is about Greg Louganis, the 1960-born American tower spring legend. After his victory at Olympia, Chinese people increasingly began to visit him in training and take photos and video recordings from him. They wanted to train the Chinese team to excellent tower jumpers and copy the style of Louganis. They also managed to do this first and at the next Olympic games the Chinese tower jumpers were clearing off well. Four years later, when all the world counted them among the favorites, they failed. What happened? For the first
Playing after modeling prevailed almost perfect wind conditions. Four years later there was a slight wind. The Chinese had learned to make a perfect leap under perfect conditions, but they had not learned - like Greg Louganis - to balance and correct the unperfect conditions.</p>
<p>So it is for me also with the application of NLP. If my counterpart responds perfectly to everything I offer, then I will succeed with a standard approach. But as soon as something changes, I have to be deeper and understand what I'm doing.</p>
<p>There are two more levels in the CP3. These are principles and the concept level (like concept, therefore the C at the beginning). If I understand the principles behind a change technique, I am able to derive more than one process from it. Now there are many creative possibilities for new ways of change. At the first level "concept" is a definition or delimitation of one thing. It is about determining what is something and what is it not.</p>
<p>Since I have the CP3 at my seminars in mind, my participants have been able to transfer much more content to their everyday life and to a variety of areas. At the same time, they learn something about this abstraction process in general, so they are able to discover more superior processes in other areas of their lives and to find general principles behind the methods.</p>
<p>Our task is now that this language is also spoken in as many contexts as possible: schools, daycare facilities, business, hospitals, politics and many other contexts.</p>
<h2>NLP in Schulen</h2>
<p>Teachers begin to understand that different types of students need different didactic procedures and different tasks.</p>
<p>They are willing to invest time and effort to acquire adequate strategies. This includes, for example, the 4MAT system, which originally comes from pedagogy, but with NLP methods, can develop a significantly stronger force. Another example here are the NLP meta programs (e.g. overview - detail, to - away from, proactive - reactive) or preferred channels of perception (visual, auditive, kinetic, olfactory, gustatory).</p>
<p>Teachers begin to model each other in terms of successful and motivating approaches to the respective technical topics. Internet databases are created in which teachers can download practice-proven and excitingly prepared teaching units from their colleagues. After the lesson with this material, they also share the acquired knowledge online with the interested parties. Students can also give their impressions here.</p>
<p>The school develops into a place where self-guided learning is possible. Teachers and pupils are given more scope to reorder their learning material, to focus on and to shape learning.</p>
<p>Parents learn with the help of NLP to help their children overcome fears, reduce aggressiveness, solve concentration problems. They understand better how their children tick and can help them develop positive beliefs.</p>
<h2>NLP in Kindertageseinrichtungen</h2>
<p>Children learn how to develop a positive self-esteem, what are values and how to achieve their goals. You feel better understood. The children are strengthened by relaxation exercises and other NLP techniques for life. They build up strong beliefs and trust to follow their own life.</p>
<h2>What has already been tried to shape the future?</h2>
<p>The <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp/dvnlp-und-inlpta.html#dvnlp" title="DVNLP">-->German Association for Neurolinguistic Programming (DVNLP)<!--</a>--> has sought good relations and positive influences on politics. This project is condemned to failure as long as not a broad mass of people and therefore voters are attached to the NLP.</p>
<p>It was also attempted to make studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP. But even if it succeeds in doing such studies, they will always be answered with old camels, so that it seems almost hopeless to want to do something in this way.</p>
<h3>The view forward</h3>
<p>I think it just takes a lot of people who have recognized the importance and effectiveness of NLP for their own lives and who use it in an integral way of life. If these people then begin to act responsibly in the social sense, they can successfully use themselves for the common good in the outlined yellow sense.</p>
<p>My aim is therefore to help spread a further branch alongside NLP in the coaching channel, which is about using NLP as a tool for the potential development of people. So people are able to make more out of their chances and opportunities.</p>
<p>We have an approach with a gigantic potential. NLP is a treasure for humanity. Let's lift this treasure and spread it to everyone. Let us ensure development in a holistic sense - development for the individual and development for society.</p>
<p>Become an active part in the NLP community. Live NLP every day in the encounters with other people. I would like to close with my favorite quote from Mahatma Gandhi: "Be the change you want to see in the world."</p>
