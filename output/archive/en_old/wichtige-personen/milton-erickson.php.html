<p>Milton Hyland Erickson was born in Aurum in December 1901 and is considered one of the most influential psychotherapists of the 20th century. He was a specialist in psychiatry, psychiatrist and psychotherapist, but above all the founder of modern hypnosis therapy. His unusual, often paradoxical interventions, his ingenious observation and his deeply individual access to patients made him a legend in the therapeutic world. Erickson's approach was characterized by pragmatism, creativity and deep respect for the unconscious resources of the human being. Many of his methods are considered today as the foundation of modern short-term therapy, NLP (Neurolinguistic programming), solution-oriented therapy and coaching.</p>
<h2>Childhood &amp; Youth</h2>
<p>Milton Hyland Erickson became 5. December 1901 was born second of nine children of the spouses Albert and Clara Erickson. His father came from Norwegian immigrants, his mother was part of an old-seen family from New England. The family first lived in the west of the USA, but moved to Lowell, Wisconsin in 1906, where Milton attended primary school and later high school in Wishfield.</p>
<p>Early on, Erickson was experiencing various challenges. He suffered from Legasthenie, was colour-blind, had no musical hearing and difficulties in the language understanding. In school he was therefore temporarily considered to be "remaining". His nickname was "Dictionary" because he always started reading the dictionary from the front when he searched for a term -- a logical, though time-consuming strategy for him. In order to overcome his reading problems, he developed his own method: he introduced letters hallucinatively in front of his inner eye and thus trained his visual imagination -- an earlier document for his creative use of inner processes, which later also shaped his therapy work.</p>
<p>In 1919, shortly after his high school degree, he hit him with a heavy stroke of fate: he drank to paralysis of children and fell into the coma. When he came to consciousness three days later, his entire body was paralyzed. The doctors gave him little hope. He sat in a swing chair -- and one day noticed that the chair moved slightly, triggered by his desire to see from the window. This experience -- an ideomotoric movement -- was a turning point for him. He began to consciously visualize how his muscles move, and trained so -- purely mental -- his body functions.</p>
<p>Through persistent mental exercise and intense imagination, he managed to perform first movements within one year. After all, he could go with crutches. Contrary to medical advice, he took a 1,200 miles long canoe trip on the Mississippi -- a journey that physically and mentally strengthened him. Two years later he went without crutches, only a slight hint on the right side remained.</p>
<p>These early experiences of physical limitation, mental self-healing and the power of inner images marked Erickson's whole therapeutic thinking. His conviction that the human mind has enormous resources for self-healing was not based on theory -- but on personal experience.</p>
<h2>Education &amp; academic career</h2>
<p>After his remarkable recovery from childhood paralysis, Milton Erickson began studying at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1921. There he first studied psychology, later in addition medicine. Already in this time, his extraordinary observation and interest in nonverbal communication were shown. Thus, he reported that, as part of his studies, he observed people on the street for hours in order to conclude inner conditions from posture, mimics and body language -- an ability that he later used masterfully in hypnosis and psychotherapy. In the second year at the university he came into contact with hypnosis. He was fascinated by the possibilities, practiced unreleased, elaborated different techniques and explored the influence of people. In contrast to the prevailing teaching concept, Erickson developed individualizable methods.</p>
<p>In 1928 Erickson completed his studies with an M.D. (Doctor of Medicine). In 1930, an additional degree in psychiatry followed before working at Wayne State University in Detroit between 1930 and 1934. It is particularly worth mentioning that Erickson completed his training at a time when the academic psychiatry was strongly influenced by biological-medical thinking -- Freud's concepts or hypnotic procedures were considered to be marginal phenomena in the U.S. specialist world or were even covered. Despite this attitude, Erickson was not able to derive from his practical experience and his deep conviction from the effectiveness of trance and suggestion.</p>
<p>After studying, he went through a number of specialist stations. He completed his residency in psychiatry at the Worcester State Hospital (Massachusetts), where he continued to deal with hypnosis under rather restrictive conditions. Later he worked at several clinics, including Rhode Island, Michigan and Eloise State Hospital. During his time at the Eloise Hospital he was known for his unusually successful treatment approaches with schizophrenia patients -- an area where he later delivered groundbreaking contributions.</p>
<p>In 1948 Erickson was appointed a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona in Phoenix. He began to carry out extensive teaching and lecture activities and trained doctors, therapists and psychologists in clinical hypnosis. While many of his early writings appeared in rather obscure medical journals, his work was accessible to a wider public by publishing case stories and transcripts by students such as Jay Haley, Jeffrey Point or Sidney Rosen. In this form, Erickson's influence later came into many modern forms of therapy -- despite initial academic scepticism.</p>
<h2>Career &amp; development of hypnotherapy</h2>
<p>After his medical degree in 1928 and his psychiatric training, Milton Erickson worked at several psychiatric institutions in the USA. One of his award-winning stations was the Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts, where he gained first clinical experience with hypnosis. Unlike many of his contemporaries Erickson Hypnose considered not as a mystical method, but as a natural state that can be used therapeutically.</p>
<p>He developed his own approach early on: an indirect, permissive form of hypnosis, which later became world famous as "Erickson's hypnosis". This was no longer about authoritarian commands or standardized suggestions, but about activating work with the patient's inner resources, through stories, metaphors, paradoxical interventions or subtle linguistic twists.</p>
<p>In the 1930s and 40s he practiced as a clinic director and senior psychiatrist at the Eloise State Hospital (Michigan), where he worked with many chronically mentally ill patients. His treatment approaches in schizophrenia and psychosomatic diseases were particularly unusual but often successful. His methods were often radically experiential, very individually adapted and far ahead of his time.</p>
<p>In 1958 he founded the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, which he issued until 1968, and in 1978 he founded the Milton Erickson Society for Clinical Hypnosis, which offers training and further training in clinical hypnosis therapy.</p>
<p>Despite multiple health rebates -- among other things several new polio strokes -- Erickson could not be stopped from his therapeutic work. In the last few decades of his life, he has practised mainly from his own home in Phoenix, Arizona, which became a kind of pilgrimage site for therapists from all over the world.</p>
<h2>Importance</h2>
<p>Milton H. Erickson left a profound influence on modern psychotherapy, especially through its innovative use of hypnosis. Instead of authoritarian suggestions, he used subtle, indirect language patterns, metaphors and stories to initiate changes in the unconscious of his client. His individualized, respectful approach always stressed the uniqueness of each person and its resources for self-healing.</p>
<p>Erickson is due to the fact that hypnosis has been used in psychotherapy again after it has long been put into the background by Sigmund Freud's rejection. He developed a new approach. This emphasizes the individuality of each individual client/patient and consequently the need to find the appropriate approach and access for everyone. This approach was in contrast to the standardized and authoritarian methods that were predominant up to the 50s and 60s. Erickson also emphasizes the positive role of the unconscious. Unlike Freud, the unconscious is an inexhaustible resource for creative self-healing. The unconscious is the hort of people's unused experiences. Erickson's approach aims to expand the ability of consciousness limited by rigid schemes and patterns of thought by enabling the hypnotist to take the leading role through special verbal and non-verbal techniques. At the same time, awareness is enabled to accept and integrate the unconscious self-healing forces and creative resources.</p>
<p>Erickson had an enormous effect on the entire therapeutic fellowship and his afterworld. He shaped Jay Haley, Paul Watzlawick, John Weakland, and with them the entire Palo-Alto group, influenced the family therapy at the time, and many schools of systemic therapy, especially the solution-focused approach of Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg, the provocative therapy of Frank Farrelly and the systemic structures of Insa Sparrer and Matthias Vardé.</p>
<h2>Influence on NLP</h2>
<p>From the early 1970s Erickson was not only known for his therapeutic successes, but also as a model for a new generation of psychologists and communication experts. His indirect, linguistically highly differentiated mode of communication was particularly impressed by two young Californians: Richard Bandler and John Grinder.</p>
<p>These began to systematically analyze exceptionally successful therapists as part of their so-called "modeling" -- including Fritz Perls, Virginia Satir and Milton Erickson. Her analysis of Erickson was mainly related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>its precise language guidance (Milton model),</li>
<li>his flexible handling of trance states,</li>
<li>its ability to activate unconscious processes,</li>
<li>and its strategic use of ambiguities, metaphors and suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result was a linguistically sound model of hypnotic language patterns known today as the Milton model -- one of the central language pattern tools in the NLP. It forms the counterpart to the so-called meta-model of the language that originated from the analysis of Virginia Satir. Many NLP techniques, such as anchoring, reframing, swish techniques or handling unconscious signals, can be traced directly or indirectly to Erickson's therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Although he himself was not actively involved in the construction of NLP, he is considered one of the three 'Urväter', alongside Virginia Satir and Fritz Perls. His attitude to enable change through internal processes and creative communication continues to be in psychotherapy, coaching and consulting.</p>
<h2>Therapeutic approach</h2>
<p>Erickson's teaching style was as unusual as his psychotherapeutic therapies. He preferred small groups, often in his own living room in Phoenix. His demonstrations often consisted of anecdotes, case stories or seemingly incidental narratives that contained profound teachings.</p>
<p>He taught through experience, not through theory. Many of his students reported that they often only understood months later what he wanted to give them with an apparently casual sentence or a paradoxical exercise. His approach was characterized by respect, patience and the conviction that learning is best done through personal insight and not through teaching.</p>
<p>Erickson used metaphors, stories, humor, interpretations, surprise techniques, paradoxical interventions and symbolic tasks to initiate change processes. For him, the unconscious was not a source of interference, but a source of resources, healing and creative solutions.</p>
<p>Another key concept of his work was utilisation -- i.e. the consistent use of everything the patient brings: symptoms, speech, peculiarities, resistances, habits. There were no obstacles for Erickson, but only potential for change.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc;">
<p><em>"People are not sick, they are only trapped in one way."</em></p>
<p><em>"If you want to change the behavior of a person, you need to reach his unconscious mind."</em></p>
<p><em>"Each change begins with a change in perception."</em></p>
<p><em>"The unconscious knows more than the consciousness can suspect."</em></p>
<p><em>"Hypnosis is not when someone does something, but if someone allows something."</em></p>
</div>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Milton H. Erickson married for the first time in 1925. Three children came out of this marriage. Marriage was divorced in 1935. Shortly afterwards, Erickson met his later wife Betty, whom he married in 1936. With her he got five more children.</p>
<p>In 1947 Erickson suffered an injury after a bicycle crash that made a tetanus vaccination necessary. Despite his well-known allergy to the vaccine, he was inoculated, which led to a severe anaphylactic shock, which he survived only slightly. As a result, he developed a strong allergy to pollen, which forced him to move into the milder climate of Phoenix, Arizona. There he opened a private practice, which he later operated for further allergies to house dust and various foods directly from home.</p>
<p>In 1953, Erickson regained paralysis with muscle dystrophy. Despite these health setbacks, he continued his literary work and his lecture tours as far as possible. During this time he worked closely with renowned colleagues like Jay Haley, Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead, Lawrence Kubie and John Weakland.</p>
<p>Due to his deteriorating health condition, Erickson gave his lecture and travel activities in 1969 and his private practice in 1974. In 1976 he suffered another severe phase of paralysis, accompanied by muscle wounds and multiple pain. He then had to rely on a wheelchair and suffered a half-face paralysis.</p>
<p>Milton H. Erickson died on 25. March 1980 at his house in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p>Milton Erickson was described by contemporaries as exceptionally resilient, humorous and ingenious. Despite his severe physical limitations, he always showed a strong will and a positive attitude of life, which also reflected in his therapeutic work and made him the symbol of modern hypnosis. His ability to master his physical challenges with creative solutions impressed both family and colleagues. As a family father, he was engaged and tried to maintain a close bond to his eight children despite the burdens of illness. Besides his work, Erickson appreciated nature and liked to take long walks, which helped him strengthen body and mind. His origins from a Norwegian-American family in Wisconsin marked his grounded, at the same time humorous and practical way that he kept alive.</p>
