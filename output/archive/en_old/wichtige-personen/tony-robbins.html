</div>
<p>Tony Robbins (born 29. February 1960 in Glendora, California) is an American motivation coach, author and entrepreneur. He became famous for his energetic live seminars, combining elements from psychology, NLP and behavioral training. Its influence ranges from personal coaching formats to large audience events in over 100 countries. He is one of the most influential personalities of personality development</p>
<h2>Childhood &amp; Youth</h2>
<p>Tony Robbins was born on 29 February 1960 in North Hollywood, California as Anthony J. Mahavorick. He grew up as the oldest of three children in a broken family in Glendora. After his parents divorced, he accepted the last name of his second stepfather Robbin. His childhood was characterized by financial uncertainty and emotional abuse, which Robbins later described as a driving factor for his later career. He took responsibility for his siblings early. In his youth he went through an unusual growth push (due to a hypophysenadenom) that made him grow to over two meters.</p>
<p>At the age of 17, he left his parents' house due to ongoing conflicts with his mother and worked as a master and parade worker. At the advice of his landlord, he first heard lectures by the speaker Jim Rohn -- a turning point in his life.</p>
<h2>Self-study</h2>
<p>During his school days, Tony Robbins already fell through his high energy, his tireless ambition and his leadership qualities. However, Robbins did not propose a classic college or university route.</p>
<p>Through an acquaintance Robbins learned 17 from a performance of the well-known motivational speaker Jim Rohn. This encounter was a turning point in his life: Rohn's philosophy that personal development was the result of conscious decisions and daily self-discipline was the foundation of his own mind for Robbins. After the lecture, Robbins Rohn spoke directly. Shortly after that he got the chance to work for Rohn, first as a seller of seminar places, later as a personal assistant and close associate.</p>
<p>In the following years Robbins developed his skills autodidacically. He developed intensively in the fields of psychology, communication strategies, hypnosis, NLP, body language, sales psychology and peak performance coaching. He attended seminars and workshops of sizes such as John Grinder, Richard Bandler, Virginia Satir and others. His training in NLP, which Robbins completed with Grinder, was particularly impressive. He developed his own, simplified and practical method to make NLP accessible to a mass audience.</p>
<p>Although Robbins never acquired a formal university degree, he has a wide range of practical knowledge and has received numerous certificates from further education and training courses during his career. In later years, he was awarded by various organisations for his contributions to further education and personality development, including honorary doctors.</p>
<h2>Career &amp; milestones</h2>
<p>After Robbins learned the basics of selling, coaching and personal development under the guidance of Jim Rohn, he began to walk his own paths. At the beginning of 20 he founded his first training company. He organized small workshops, lectures in schools, municipalities and companies -- often for very small fees or even free of charge. He used every opportunity to practice, get feedback and build a reputation.</p>
<p>A key event was his encounter with the therapist and NLP co-founder John Grinder. Robbins got to know NLP (Neuro-Linguistic programming) intensively and soon became one of the most famous coaches in this field. He took over, above all, the modeling of successful people -- a technique with which to take over excellent skills through systematic analysis and imitation.</p>
<p>He developed his own methods on this basis, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>the so-called "Swish" anchor (it already appears in the classic NLP but was greatly simplified and popularized by Robbins)</li>
<li>the "Neuro-Associative Conditioning" technique (a kind of emotional recoding, where old emotional patterns are "decoupled" and new established),</li>
<li>as well as a separate variant of the Firewalk (bare walk over glowing coals), which became the ritual of many of his seminars.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breakthrough with Firewalk &amp; TV Infomercials</h2>
<p>The real breakthrough came in the early 1980s when Robbins decided to use the Firewalk as a symbolic tool for overcoming fear in his seminars. The strong visual effect of this ritual -- coupled with Robbins' energy-charged style -- ensured attention.</p>
<p>Then followed the perhaps most important milestone: Robbins produced its own TV infomercial, which was broadcast worldwide in the late 1980s. In the spot he presented his program "Personal Power" -- an audio cassette with training lessons for self-motivation, target achievement and inner strength. The campaign became a huge commercial success. Within a few years Robbins has been known internationally through this media presence.</p>
<h2>Construction of an empire</h2>
<p>In the 1990s, Robbins continued to expand its brand. He developed a number of live seminars, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unleash the Power Within (UPW),</li>
<li>Date with Destiny,</li>
<li>Business Mastery,</li>
<li>and the exclusive Platinum Partnership Program for high-end customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>He worked as a coach for top executives, including CEOs such as Marc Benioff (Salesforce) or Bill Clinton, but also for athletes and other celebrities such as Serena Williams,Greg Norman, Mike Tyson, Chuck Liddell, Diego Sanchez, Andre Agassi and teams such as the Los Angeles Kings. His consulting firm Robbins Research International (RRI) became one of the world's most famous coaching organizations, and Tony Robbin's multiple best-selling author.</p>
<p>In addition to the seminar, Robbins increasingly invested in companies, foundations and non-profit projects, e.g. in educational programs, food donations (Feeding America) and water treatment initiatives in developing countries.</p>
<h2>Further milestones:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2014:</strong> He publishes Money: Master the Game -- a bestseller about financial education that emerged after the financial crisis and contains interviews with top investors like Ray Dalio.</li>
<li><strong>2016:</strong> Netflix publishes the Doku I Am Not Your Guru via Robbins' seminar "Date with Destiny".</li>
<li><strong>2020:</strong> Due to the pandemic, Robbins puts many content into the virtual and develops new event formats with giant LED walls (360° Virtual Studio).</li>
</ul>
<h2>setbacks and personal challenges</h2>
<p>Although Robbins publicly often appears as a powerful, self-confident speaker, his way was not free from setbacks. In the early years of his career, as he himself often describes, he suffered financial difficulties. There were times when, according to his own statement, he had hardly any money for food. The early construction of his business was associated with high personal victims, including lack of sleep, social isolation and high performance pressure.</p>
<p>Also in later years there was criticism and controversy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robbins has been criticized several times by former participants: in the media because of his authoritarian appearance or separate statements -- especially in the years 2018/19, when BuzzFeed published a series of reports that claimed that Robbins had been respectless to women. Robbins and his team strongly rejected the accusations. The discussions led to a public discourse on coaching ethics, power relations and role models.</li>
<li>In addition, he was accused of partially simplifying complex psychological processes or missing scientific findings. Robbins himself has always understood himself as an intern and result-focused coach, not as an academic psychologist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these challenges, Robbins remained public and used many of these conflicts to reposition its brand.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Tony Robbins was married twice. His first marriage with Becky Robbins (a former seminar participant) began in 1984 and ended in 2001 after more than 15 years. Robbins adopted their three children from an earlier relationship and together they have a son, Jairek Robbins, who is also a personality coach today.</p>
<p>Since 2001, Robbins has been married to Canadian actress Sage Robbins (born Bonnie Pearl Humphrey). She is often at his side at seminars and herself as a speaker. Today, the couple lives mainly in Florida and Fiji, where Robbins operates a resort (Namale Resort &amp; Spa).</p>
<h2>Training style &amp;amp; philosophy</h2>
<p>Tony Robbins is known for an intense, immersive training style that combines emotional energy, physical activation and mental clarity to create excellence. His events often last several days, are very interactive and use music, group exercises and methods from NLP, hypnotherapy and systemic coaching. Robbins follows the principle of "learning": transformation is done through direct experience, not only through intellectual knowledge.</p>
<p>A central part of his philosophy is the concept of 'neuro-associative conditioning' (NAC), in which emotions are linked to new patterns of thought and behaviour. Robbins also teaches how important it is to make your own identity, the environment (“Proximity is Power”) and decision strategies aware. Its methodology is heavily based on modeling successful people: it analyzes how successful people think and act, and translates this into practically applicable tools for their participants.</p>
<h2>Influence &amp; Legacy of Tony Robbins</h2>
<p>Tony Robbins is one of the most influential personalities in the field of coaching and personality development and peak performance of the late 20th and early 21st. century and the 20 most influential figures in the USA. His seminars, books, audio programs and online offers have helped, achieved and inspired millions of people around the world -- from individuals to leaders of large corporations.</p>
<p>He is the author of three books that have been translated into 14 languages worldwide: 'Grenzenlose Energie', 'Das Robbins Power Principle' and 'Erfolgssteps nach dem Power Principle'. He has produced the most sold audio program of all time in the field of personal development, 'Personal Power', with 25 million copies sold.</p>
<p>Robbins has significantly contributed to coaching as a concept becoming socially capable. In the 1980s and 1990s, coaching was often regarded as esoteric or psychologically marginal -- but Robbins gave the picture of a pragmatic, energetic trainer that allows change through action. Thanks to its publicly active style and the wide-ranging effect of its content, he has helped to ensure that coaching is recognized today as a legitimate form of personal and professional development.</p>
<p>His influence on the development of a "result-oriented coaching culture" was particularly striking, with less concern for long-term analysis processes, but rather practical solutions, state work and clear target definitions. Many modern coaches are based on Robbins' methodology: visualization techniques, target work, storytelling, state management and interventions in group settings.</p>
<p>Numerous successful coaches - including internationally known names - openly indicate that they were inspired by Robbins or trained in his trainings. This means that Robbins has not only influenced individuals but also shaped an entire industry.</p>
<p>In addition to coaching, Robbins also left a sustainable footprint in the philanthropy field: He supports organisations such as Feeding America, has donated over 800 million meals and is committed to clean drinking water and education worldwide.</p>
<p>Despite criticism, for example because of lack of scientific discovery, Tony Robbins has managed to bridge the gap between self-help, leadership development and economic training. His brand today stands for personal growth with a global perspective -- and his legacy is not only reflected in his publications, but also in an international community of coaches, trainers and entrepreneurs: women who continue their work.</p>
