<p>Read here about the exciting history of the formation of the NLP. We report on the initial times and the most important persons involved. NLP was founded by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. Many years later, Frank Pucelik reappeared as the third co-founder. We report on this in the blog article <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-blog/dritte-mann-im-nlp/" target="_blank" title="Frank Pucelik NLP">-->"The Third Man in the NLP"<!--</a>-->.</p>
<p>The first years and the first NLP books focused on modeling the work of some outstanding therapists. The doctoral student of John Grinder, the famous anthropologist Gregory Bateson, established some important contacts and initially supported the work of the two pioneers. Bandler and Grinder first modeled Fritz Perls, the family therapist Virginia Satir and the hypnotherapeuten Dr. Milton H. Erickson. This resulted in the first NLP formats and methods that then found further dissemination.</p>
<p>As a result, other people came into contact with NLP and drove the spread and further development forward. Robert Dilts, who brought many new approaches and impulses into the NLP, was very active in the further development. For the mass distribution, the American success trainer is

<h2>History of the NLP - Introduction</h2>
<p><!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp/was-ist-nlp.html" title="Was ist NLP?">-->NLP<!--</a>--> (Neurolinguistic programming) is a communication and motivation model developed in the early 1970s, which shows the patterns that use outstanding individuals in all conceivable social areas to achieve excellent results.<br/>
NLP is based on the basic idea of modeling (modeling, modeling). The patterns and skills thus discovered and discovered can lead to more personal growth, accelerated learning and a strong improvement in communication skills.<br/>
The founders of the NLP are John Grinder and Richard Bandler. They developed NLP by a combination of observation and analysis of the most successful psychotherapists of their time.<br/>
NLP makes it possible to discover the differences between people who achieve outstanding successes in dealing with themselves and others and those who are unable to effectively influence themselves or other people.

<h2>NLP History - Overview</h2>
<p>The original form of today's NLP was created in the early 1970s. Richard Bandler, who was a student at the University of California in Santa Cruz, met the assistant professor for Linguistics John Grinder.<br/><br/> 
Grinder, who was particularly interested in advanced teaching methods, quickly became aware of Bandler's work and conducted a number of seminars in consultation with him.<br/><br/>
In the beginning, these seminars had the status of group experiments. But with increasing experience and knowledge of Bandler and Grinder, participants experienced more and more exciting change processes. Thus a cooperation was created between Bandler and Grinder,
which has become increasingly narrower and deeper over the years.<br/><br/>  
They went together to ask why some well-known psychotherapists had so much success in their work with their patients and what this success was based on. While at the same time many others who treated the same patients with the same disorders did not manage such dramatic changes. Bandler and Grinder's initial hypothesis were that they subordinated the successful psychotherapists a common or similar behavioral pattern in their work with people on the basis of which they could achieve such outstanding results.<br/><br/>  
These common or similar behaviour patterns are today
as NLP or as the structure of magic.<br/><br/>   
Thus they began to investigate the forms of therapy of the top therapists of the time
and to analyze:</p>
<ul class="ul-content1">
<li>Virginia Satir, an exceptional family therapist</li>
<li>Fritz Perls, an innovative design therapist and founder of this therapy direction, and</li>
<li>Milton Erickson, a world-famous hypnotherapeute.</li>
</ul>
<p>They were always guided by the hope of discovering patterns and structures,
who were able to explain the success of these leaders in dealing with their clients.<br/><br/> 
After long and careful observation, Grinder and Bandler discovered
Diversity of the three successful psychotherapists, that these
surprisingly similar basic patterns used in their work with other people.<br/><br/>  
These basic patterns held Grinder and Bandler in writing, refined
they, in their seminars, tried out with other students who
ready to explain and finally developed an elegant model,
that was applicable to achieving more effective communication, accelerated
Learning, personal change, and to learn more enjoyment and joy in life.<br/><br/>  
They called it NLP - Neurolinguistic programming. “Neuro” because it is
Strategies that act strongly the functions of our nervous system (brain + spinal cord + sense)
contain. It is about more accurate and more to perceive unwanted <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/coaching-welt/wissen/lexikon/gefuehle.html" title="Gefühle" target="_blank">-->Feelings<!--</a>--> and
To change behaviour patterns in line with yourself in a targeted manner.<br/><br/>
“Linguistics” because it is very much about the linguistic aspect. We
entertain both external communication to other people and one
Communication inward to our wonderful “biocomputer” – our brain.
Unfortunately, obviously not all the inputs we enter into this biocomputer
do. This requires advanced communication methods.<br/><br/>
“Programming” means that we use systematic methods in all this
do not want to learn through trial and error. It is about procedures and procedures
to discover which can also be transferred to other areas and persons.
Many NLP techniques are maintenance-free, i.e. you can use the same method
for headaches, a phobia or to build up irresistible motivation.
NLP describes procedures and processes that run independently of the content
can and act.<br/><br/>
Starting from this approach, NLP developed into two complementary

<h2>The Life of Richard Bandler</h2>
<p>Richard Bandler was born in New Jersey in 1950. In the mid-60s he joined the hippie movement and was one of the long-haired flower children. In 1967 he organized rock concerts and gave drum lessons to Dan Spitzer, the son of Robert Spitzer, a renowned psychiatrist and president of the publishing house “Science &amp; Behavior Books”. Through this music teaching, he talked to Frau Spitzer more often and discovered that Richard Bandler was very open to all philosophical questions and that he had a special way to teach her son the piano play. Over time, the leaders tried to further promote Richard Bandler's talents, as they saw a very talented and extremely skillful young man in him. Robert Spitzer employed him a time later in his publishing house and taught him various publishing activities.<br/><br/>  
After college, Richard Bandler started studying philosophy, mathematics and computer science at the University of California in Santa Cruz. In addition to these subjects, however, the behavioural sciences and their studies have become increasingly important over time. He gave special attention to the therapy methods of Friedrich Perls, the founder of the form therapy.<br/><br/>

Eines Tages begegnete er in Reno der erfolgreichen Familientherapeuten Virginia Satir auf einer ihrer Workshops und war von deren Arbeit sehr begeistert.<br/><br/>   
By reporting his experiences with Virginia Satir, Robert Spitzer received the commission to travel to Canada on behalf of his publisher and to record and transcribe a four-week seminar with Virginia Satir. While Bandler accepted this order and worked intensively with Satir's work for the following months, he took more and more Virginia Satir's expression and choice of words as a miracle of his friends.<br/><br/> 
Shortly after Bandler edits and transcribed the material of Virginia Satir, Robert Spitzer asked him to process the material of Friedrich Perls, the well-known design therapists, and to design a manuscript. As with Virginia Satir, Bandler worked intensively with the extensive material of Perls and started to imitate the type of speech and even the behavior. It is reported that Spitzer Bandler even spoke with “Fritz” for a mistake, because he was just too similar to him.<br/><br/> 
Fritz Perls then inspired Bandler so much that he had three books published with the material he obtained.
The titles of the books were:</p>
<ul class="ul-content1"><li>“The Design Approach”</li>
<li>‘Eye Witness to Therapy’ and</li>
<li>“Legacy from Fritz”.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Life of John Grinder</h2>
<p>John Thomas Grinder was born on 10 January 1939 in Michigan/USA. He studied at the University of San Francisco and completed his studies in philosophy in the early 1960s. He then entered the military and served as Green Beret in Europe. After working for a few years as an undercover agent of the CIA, he began studying Linguistics at the University of California in San Diego at the end of the 1960s.<br/><br/>
In 1972 he became Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the University of Santa Cruz. Since John Grinder was interested in advanced learning methods, he became supervisor for Richard Bandler's design therapy seminars.<br/><br/>
In order to expand the newly discovered area of the NLP, he developed new patterns in the mid-70s. The result was the current model of the NLP in the mid-1980s.<br/><br/>
Grinder has written 14 books about NLP and many more about Linguistics. His work has been significantly influenced by his mentor Gregory Bateson. Bateson was also the one who contacted John Grinder and Richard Bandler with the hypnotherapeuten Milton H. Erickson.</p>
<h2>Beginning of the NLP</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1972, Bandler offered a seminar on form therapy driven by the lack of practical reference to his studies. This was then possible for the students in an advanced semester. His interest was primarily in researching the therapeutic effect of design work within a group and developing his theoretical competence in practice.<br/><br/>
During these seminars, John Grinder became aware of Bandler's work and joined him and his research. From now on, they worked together on Bandler's seminars, where John Grinder was still a newcomer in the field of counseling and psychotherapy.<br/><br/>  
Between 1972 and 1974, intensive and fruitful cooperation took place, benefiting Grinder from Bandler's knowledge of psychotherapy and Bandler from Grinder's knowledge of linguistics.<br/><br/>
This combination was especially valuable for modeling the therapeutic highlights of Virginia Satir, Friedrich Perls and the hypnotherapeuten Milton Erickson. When modeling, specific skills of a person are made accessible and usable by systematic and accurate observation and surveying for others. Patterns and rules were derived, so that the skills involved could also be imitated by third parties.<br/><br/>
Bandler and Grinder were not primarily about describing something true, but rather making something useful for others learnable. As a confirmation of the success of their analyses and observations at Satir and Perls, they saw the confirmation that they were able to produce the same results in other people as the person they had modeled.<br/><br/> 
At the beginning of 1974, both began to develop the first meta-model structures with a student group held in a occupied house on Mission Street in Santa Cruz. The meta-model is, in simplified terms, a model of very specific questions that can be used to identify thought structures and gain profound information. The starting point of research in the Meta-Model groups was the consideration that the verbal exchange between therapist and the client is a central characteristic of any therapeutic change work. Consequently, it was assumed that in the verbal communication of Friedrich Perls and Virginia Satir specific language patterns would crystallize out and could be cemented, that make the problematic processes aware and induce changes.<br/><br/>
Through the linguistic background knowledge of John Grinder, both researchers managed to create starting points for a model that enabled the targeted collection of information about the world of vision of a human being. They modeled the essential linguistic skills of Perls and Satir and managed to explicitly describe these structures and thus to be able to pass on them.<br/><br/> 
From the end of 1974, Bandler and Grinder regularly attended teaching seminars of the hypnotherapeuten Milton H. Erickson. Again with the primary goal of studying Erickson's work with people and taking on his language patterns and behaviors. As with Satir and Perls, the results obtained were refined, recorded in writing, checked for their applicability in student groups and integrated into the existing knowledge package.<br/><br/> 
In 1974 and 1975 the aim of group work was to develop further formal models for communication. Since the nonverbal behavior of Perls, Satir and Erickson seemed to contribute significantly to the therapeutic effect achieved in addition to the speech behavior, the effective nonverbal elements were then primarily analyzed and attempted to present. The models were later used not only for psychotherapy, but also for everyday communication.<br/><br/>
Various methods were used and redesigned, which led to the current form of the NLP in addition to the methods of Perls and Satir. Bandler and Grinder documented their first discoveries in the four books published between 1975 and 1977.<br/><br/>
These were:</p>
<ul class="ul-content1"><li>The Structure of Magic I und II</li>
<li>Patterns of the hypnothic techniques of Milton H. Erickson I und II.</li></ul>
<p>In 1977 Grinder and Bandler held their first public seminars in the USA. The seminars were very fast sounded. NLP's acquaintance grew rapidly in the following years and is now used worldwide, especially in the field of therapy, education and management.<br/><br/>
In 1982, Bandler and Grinder developed the concept of reframing. It shows how to contact with unconscious proportions that are the cause of unwanted behavior or disease symptoms. In this way, changes were possible which were previously only under a classic <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/hypnose/hypnose-uebersicht.html" title="Hypnose">--><u>hypnosis</u><!--</a>--> were conceivable.<br/><br/>
In 1984 the concept of submodalities and thus one of the most effective and impressive techniques of the NLP was invented. The submodalities represent a quasi-programming language of the brain, which can be used consciously by any person when he knows the commands. People take up information with their five senses, process and store these internally as events and thoughts which are represented within their meaning - the so-called modalities. These modalities can in turn be specified more precisely and so it is possible to ask more precisely the inner image of a past experience. The special thing about this method is that it exploits the fact that the human brain reacts not only to that, WAS we think, but also to it WIE thinks a person, e.g. rather in colored images or in black-white images.<br/><br/>
In 1988, Tad James developed the Time Line therapy. This is a method that is particularly suitable for the gentle healing of traumatic experiences in the past. With the help of the timeline, unconscious or displaced traumas, which are the cause of physical or emotional problems, can be found and mentally processed.<br/><br/>
In 1990, Robert Dilts developed reimprinting, a process for changing restrictive beliefs and beliefs that emerged from the relationship structures of our childhood. An embossing (imprint) is an influential experience from the past, from which the person concerned has formed a set of beliefs or a set of beliefs that are effective in his world. Such an embossing usually also involves an unconscious takeover of roles by other important people who have to do with it. Re-Imprinting has the purpose of finding the lack of resources, changing the concept of faith and adapting the role model developed there to the real and acute circumstances of the person concerned.</p>
<p>Contrary to public opinion, Grinder and Bandler NLP did not produce on their own. There is another third competitor who, after thirty years of silence, is now coming to the public: Frank Pucelik</p>
<h2>The Life of Frank Pucelik</h2>
<p>Robert Frank Pucelik was born in Nebraska in 1945. Dispute, violence and an alcoholic father gave him a severe childhood. As a young person, he felt on the losing side of life. After his high school degree he studied psychology and political sciences, but after three years college had to leave due to lack of performance. To avoid forced recruitment, Pucelik volunteered to serve the U.S. Navy. There he received a medical training and worked as a field animator. In 1966 he found himself ill-prepared as a shooter in the Vietnam War and called this time “13 months in hell”.<br/><br/>  
After the war, he returned seriously traumatized the United States and resumed his studies. In order to work up his trauma, he began to deal with personality development, especially with the form therapy of Fritz Perls. He has now delivered top performances in his studies and committed himself socially. In this time, Pucelik also met Judith Ann DeLozier. The two fell in love and married. Her son Eric was then born in June 1970.<br/><br/> 
One year later, the family moved to Santa Cruz and the two students continue their studies at the highly sought-after Kresge College of the University of California. There, too, Pucelik socially engaged in the student crisis intervention center and he began to lead form-therapeutic groups, as he felt this approach to crisis work was enormously helpful.<br/><br/> 
Richard Bandler, who knew nothing about Pucelik's groups, decided to lead his own design-therapeutic groups at Kresge College and quickly got up. Pucelik realized that Bandler was a highly talented design trainer and thus a successful collaboration quickly emerged. They offered joint groups and later developed the “Meta” project together with John Grinder. The joint project started to open Grinder, Bandler and Pucelik literally under their hands, and they realized that they had discovered something groundbreaking. At first, Pucelik was Bandler's partner, but he started spending more and more time with Grinder. “We were still three,” Pucelik said, “I had only a different role. I became the organizer, the middleman, the experimental rabbit, the Mitwisser. For a while, I was the observer from the third position they could use to review their own thoughts and patterns. I was able to give them feedback and tell them what I thought, what works and what not.”<br/><br/> 
In 1973, Pucelik's marriage with his wife Judith ended. Little later, she became the lifemate John Grinders. Not enough. Pucelik met Leslie Cameron and the two became a couple. But three years later, in 1976, after Bandler Pucelik's partner Leslie had invited him, Grinder, Judith DeLozier and her son Eric to attend one of her study stays at Milton H. Erickson, the big break came. When the group returned, Leslie Pucelik opened to surprise that she would separate from him. She wants to be with Bandler. A few days later, Pucelik met Bandler. He urged him to go unblown. Pucelik, who found himself on the losing side of life, lost his companion, his research team, his profession, his friends and his source of income.<br/>
Nevertheless, he did his Bachelor in Psychology in the same year and founded the “Meta Institute” in San Diego one year later. He also completed his Master in Psychology and Organisational Consultancy, had a professorship at Oklahoma University in Norman and expanded the Institute of Meta International, Inc., founded in San Diego. In 1987 he established Russian contacts, moved to Moscow and began an international career as a management consultant. Today he lives as President of the “Pucelik Consulting Group” in the Ukrainian Odessa.<br/><br/> 
Pucelik's contribution to the formation of the NLP was also swept with the swoop by Bandler. Bandler and Grinder also became increasingly independent of the Meta group and began to dissolve. However, the concept of the group was purely legal. So Bandler and Grinder decided to call it “Neurolinguistic programming” (NLP). Bandler began to claim the sole authorship of the NLP from the beginning of the 1990s. He tried to enforce it legally in two court proceedings. But his efforts failed. John Grinder and Frank Pucelik are still connecting a personal friendship. In a later interview, Grinder emphasises: “No one of us could have produced the NLP alone. It was a real community work of three people.”</p>
<h2 id="virginia-satir">Biography Virginia Satir</h2>
<p>Virginia Satir was born in 1916 on a farm in the state of Wisconsin/USA. After completing high school and college, she worked for six years as a teacher to gain insights into the special situation of children with different origins. In addition to her apprenticeship, she studied social work and paralleled her psycho-analytical training. Through the opening of her own practice and the inclusion of the family in her therapeutic work, she became very well known within a few years since her type of treatment by or in the family was considered revolutionary. The success of her method gave her right and she was offered a training course for psychiatric doctors, which she went from 1955 to 1958, while she worked in parallel in her now two practices.<br/><br/>
In 1977, Virginia Satir founded the “Avanta Network” to bring together people who had enjoyed comprehensive education and shared their values.<br/><br/>

Am 10. September starb Virginia Satir mit 72 Jahren an Gelbsucht.</p>
<h2>Biography Fritz Perls</h2>
<p>Friedrich Salomon Perls became on the 8th June 1893 born in Berlin as the third child. His strict Jewish education and his father's authoritarian behaviour shaped his rebelling attitude and so he was soon considered difficult to educate. Friedrich Perls was a gifted student with excellent performance.<br/><br/> 
He began his medical studies in 1914, went to the First World War in 1916, completed his studies in 1921 with doctoral studies and opened his own practice as a psychiatrist and neurologist.<br/><br/>
In 1933 Perls had to leave Germany after the seizure of power by the Nazis.
He first went to Amsterdam with his wife and daughter Renate.
In 1934 they emigrated to South Africa, where he offered an offer as a teaching analyst
! After the resignation of Prime Minister Jan Smuts migrated
the family to America. Perls opened there after initial
Difficulties a practice.<br/><br/>  From 1948 to 1950 Perls worked together
with Paul Goodman on the development of design therapy, his resulting book
was published in 1951. In 1969 Perls founded Lake Cowichan in Canada
a design calibre that should enable continuous growth. While
a journey to Europe in the winter of 1969, Perls became surprisingly ill and died at
a trip to Chicago in March 1970.</p>
<h2 id="milton-h-erickson">History of the NLP - Biography Milton H. Erickson </h2>
<p>Milton H. Erickson was born in Nevada/USA in 1901. He has suffered severe physical impairment since his birth. He was colour-blind, suffering from tone deafness and was a legassian.<br/><br/> 
In 1919, Erickson completed high school, and he was sick of paralysis. He fell into a coma and when he woke again, he was completely paralyzed and had lost all his body perception. After a therapy and continuous training on minimal movement, Erickson's condition improved again and he could run again after a few years and visit college.<br/><br/> 
In the second year of his studies he came into contact with the technology of hypnosis and began to hypnotize people.<br/><br/>
After his studies he became a senior psychiatrist at the Worchester State Hospital's research department.<br/><br/>  
In 1947 Erickson developed a strong allergy to pollen and was again plagued by severe muscle pain and several collapses. The pollen allergy eventually required a move to Phoenix/Arizona, where he opened his own practice.<br/><br/>     
In 1953, he again suffered from paralysis of children and now suffered from recurring illnesses.<br/><br/>
In 1957 he founded the American Society for Clinical Psychology and initiated the journal “The American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis”.<br/><br/> 
Besides his co-authorship with five books, Erickson is the author of 130 essays. After many years of suffering he died in March 1980.<br/><br/>
Today it is considered the most important hypnotherapeut of the last century.</p>
<h2>Biography of Gregory Bateson</h2>
<p>Gregory Bateson had given many interdisciplinary impulses throughout his life and was thus one of the most important personalities of the 20th century. His findings have integrated the system-theoretical approach of cybernetics into human sciences and provided a basis for systemic work in psychotherapeutic practice. His works, however, are often not given enough attention, as they are both linguistically and nonconventional, complex and transdisciplinary.</p>
<p>He was born in 1904 in a bourgeois family in Grantchester, UK. His family background (his father William Bateson was a famous zoologist) as well as the proximity to the university city of Cambridge have led the young Gregory to study Zoology at Cambridge University. After his journey to the Galapagos Islands, where Darwin was researching at the time, however, he returned to England in 1925 to start studying anthropology.</p>
<p>Two years after the start of his confrontation with anthropology, he traveled to New Guinea to conduct field research at the Baining and then at the Sulka field, which should be the basis of his anthropological final work in 1930. Since Bateson was bored by the formal requirements of ethnographic research at the time, this research stay was frustrating. In 1932, during his second research trip to the Iatmul in New Guinea, he met the anthropologist Margaret Mead, who drew him attention to the differences between the sexes. However, instead of dedicating to typologising the gender differences, Bateson preferred to ask himself about the formation of the gender stereotypes that he could observe at the Iatmul. His concept of “sismogenesis” was created, which should explain how these cultural ideals arise and reproduce. Accordingly, it is not the innate character properties that affect individual behavior, but mainly the mutually influencing cumulative human interactions and relationship dynamics. This concept also influenced his ideas about the development of diseases. If character properties are not innate, mental problems cannot be attributed to internal causes. Thus, causes of diseases are to be sought in human interactions. After returning to England in 1933, Bateson began systematically analyzing his ethnographic research results and looking for patterns of human interaction. He made an attempt to create a transcultural, universal theory of personal interaction patterns, which culminated in the publication of “Naven” in 1936.</p>
<p>In 1936, together with Margaret Mead, whom he had married a year earlier, he went to Bali where, in a detailed ethnographic study, they examined in particular the socialization processes of Balinese. Surprisingly, they found that Balinesen, in contrast to the Iatmul, do not have cumulative interaction patterns which, according to the concept of schismogenesis, should be decisive for the processual formation of personality structures. The Balinese everyday did not know any cumulative emotional, rhetorical or musical patterns. The harmoniously living Balineses avoid any form of highlights that could endanger the stability of everyday life. Mead and Bateson brought this back to socialisation measures. Thus, cumulative tendencies, which they still considered universal, are reconciled from the outset and generally devalued.</p>
<p>In the early 1940s, after the publication of “Balinese Character”, Bateson, now in New York, focused on social learning processes and communication. His interest was in particular the question of how ideologies arise at individual and social level and how they are learned and reproduced. His attention increasingly turned away from ethnographic research and to learning theories of behavioral sciences. Thus he dealt with Pawlow's theory of conditioning or Skinner's theory of positive and negative amplifiers in the process of conditioning. However, Bateson criticized the approach of these researchers, who often focused on individual, learned behaviour patterns. He stressed that the learning processes are also cumulative. In the course of time you learn not only the new patterns of behavior – you also learn to learn. These considerations resulted in Bateson’s distinction between “proto-learning” and “deutero-learning”. Preuto-learning means learning simple behavior patterns, while learning deutero leads to the formation of perception, emotional and thought patterns, and in turn has an impact on proto-learning and thus has a self-confirming character.</p>
<p>Bateson's confrontation with circular learning processes led him to cybernetics. Kybernetik was born in the middle of the 20th century when the mathematician Norbert Wiener compared the mechanical feedback loop of the air guns with human nervous system. This feedback procedure leads to the evaluation of the effects of automatic actions, whereupon the future behaviour is corrected – a learning process takes place within the system (where information exchange also exists between the systems).</p>
<p>As a result, a number of transdisciplinary congresses were held, to which Gregory Bateson was invited. It is mainly due to him that the system-oriented concepts of cybernetics were included in human sciences, but in particular in psychiatry. Psychopathological phenomena become processes from a systemic perspective instead of objects standing for themselves. Consequently, it becomes irrelevant what triggered these processes; it is more sensible to ask how these are restructured – an aspect that has now been applied in psychotherapeutic practice. However, Bateson could not make any statements about how exactly this perception of reality is changed and introduced into the system so that the subsequent information processing can be re-regulated. This project was launched in the 1970s by Bandler and Grinder.</p>
<p>After the separation from Margaret Mead, Bateson went to San Francisco, where he became a member of the Palo Alto Group. During this time, his cooperation with the psychiatrist Jürgen Ruesch came to stand. Bateson and Ruesch tried to establish a general theory of human communication and to explain psychiatric phenomena systemically under the cybernetic perspective. In this context, the concept of ‘<!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/coaching-welt/wissen/coaching-themen/double-bind.html" title="Double Binds – Einfach nur widersprüchliches Reden oder krank machend?">-->double-bind<!--</a>-->“, considered by Bateson as the cause of schizophrenic phenomena. Thus, schizophrenia are not able to get on the communication <!--<a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/coaching-welt/wissen/lexikon/metaebene.html" title="Metaebene">-->meta level<!--</a>--> to move, i.e. to decipher the meanings of verbal and nonverbal messages as a function of the context. This led Bateson to the fact that contradictory statements were repeatedly made in her family environment, whose interpretation in any case had negative consequences – therefore the “double-bind” designation. In this way, psychopathological phenomena are attributed to communicative disorders within the family.</p>
<p>In psychotherapeutic work, these double-bind relationships could be restructured, but at the time concrete strategies were missing to systematically record the work of change. When Jackson, Jules Riskin and Virgina Satir founded the Mental Research Institute (MSI) in Palo Alto in 1958, Bateson was initially involved in his advisory function. In 1963, however, he retreated and turned to dolphin research. He spent a year observing the communication between dolphins on the St. Thomas Island near Puerto Rico and later on Hawai until 1967. </p>
<p>Influenced by the ecological and political crisis of the 1960s, Bateson was involved in the planning of a congress in 1967, which should deal with the influence of human habits on the environment. He wanted to point out how dangerous the interaction is within and between the systems if no self-correction takes place, which can result in planetary disasters. Even though he had no great influence on the ecological consciousness at that time, this changed a few years later when he became more involuntary to the icon of the ecology and New Age movement in California. </p>
<p>Ab 1972 lehrte er an der University of California in Santa Cruz, wo er John Grinder und daraufhin Richard Bandler begegnete. Durch Bateson wurden die beiden auf Milton H. Erickson aufmerksam, der mit seiner therapeutischen Arbeit die Beobachtungen von Grinder und Bandler inspirierte, welche bald zur Grundlage von NLP werden sollten.  </p>
<p>In the last years of his life, he studied the attempt to synthesize cybernetics and evolution, which led him back to his beginnings in Zoology. Bateson died of lung cancer in 1980. This ended the life of one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.</p>
<h2>Biography of Robert Dilts</h2>
<p>Robert Brian Dilts was born in the United States on March 21, 1955. He received his exams for behavioral technology from the University of California, and in 1977 he received the
President Underground Fellowship for researching the movement of eyes in conjunction with brain functions.
He is in the field of neuro-Linguistic programming (NLP) as an English-language book author, trainer
and NLP consultant active. Robert Dilts further developed the NLP, which was founded by John Grinder and Richard Bandler, and has a significant share in the fact that NLP continues to spread.</p>
<p>Dilts has become known above all through its development of the neurological levels. This model is now trained in almost all NLP-Practitioner training worldwide.
Although the name has repeatedly led to discussions, the usefulness and mode of operation of this model is confirmed a thousand times. In addition, he has an excellent name
made by various modeling projects. He explores, among other things, the creativity strategy of Walt-Disney and Albert Einstein and developed the strategies of the same name.</p>
<p>Robert Dilts has been a coach since 1975. His (with)developed models are:</p>
<p><u>SCORE:</u> Stands as abbreviation for: Symptom, Cause, Outcome, Resource, Effect. A model for systematic treatment of problems. Can also be used to start coaching
collect the necessary information.</p>
<p><u>The neurological levels of the NLP:</u> Serves change work. The model allows you to identify the levels that make sense for a change.</p>
<p><u>Meta-Mirror–Format:</u> Format for use in interpersonal conflicts. Enables better communication.</p>
<p><u>Sleight of Mouth:</u> A collection of patterns for powerful reflections. Also suitable for increasing the impact strength.</p>
<p>Robert Dilts is recognized as an international developer, trainer and intern. He has coveted and advised many different professions around the world.</p>
<p>In 1979-1981, Robert Dilts was appointed Vice President and Director of Research for the training and research department in NLP, where he followed Leslie Cameron Bandler-Lebeau, David
Gordon and Maribeth Meyers-Anderson have the task of creating the curricula and the test procedures for the first NLP-Practitioner and Master-Pracitioner-Certifier programs.</p>
<p>In 1981 Robert Dilts developed NLP concepts that were important for training, training and personal development.
He has invented several programs that pay particular attention to spelling and other strategies.</p>
<p>In 1982, the NLP co-inventor was involved in the establishment of the Dynamic Learning Center.</p>
<p>In 1991 the NLP University was founded by him, Judith DeLozier and Theresa Epstein. In addition, the three Dynamic Learning publications and the Academy
for behavioral technology.</p>
<p>In 1994, Robert Dilts founded the Institute for Advanced Studies of Health (IASH) with Tim Hallbom and Suzi Smith. Here is the research and dissemination for use
NLP methods in the field of health
to take place. In addition, further health certification trainings are also held, which also includes certified NLP doctors.</p>
<p>In addition, Robert Dilts is also the co-founder of the biofeedback device, one could also call it a NeuroLink. This can be recorded
and monitoring heart rate, body temperature and difference
see between the left and right half of the body. He tried to measure the activities of the nervous system with artificial intelligence
and use NLP methods. In this way, he helped people achieve an optimal state of health and to increase human learning and personal performance.</p>

<h3>Final word</h3>
<p>Over the years, the first NLP methods have been further refined – up to the form in which they are trained and applied today.<br/><br/> 
Especially in recent years, NLP has been increasingly discovered for the current economic processes and has increasingly been learned and applied by business people from the fields of marketing, sales, personnel and employee training, leadership and organization.<br/><br/>
Due to the increasing demand for NLP training, more and more people in this sector are emerging and pass on their learning to other people. In this way, the NLP will probably be further refined over the next few years and will experience improvements.</p>
