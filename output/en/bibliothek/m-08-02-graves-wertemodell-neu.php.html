<h1>Graves Model (often also Spiral Dynamics)</h1>
<p>The Graves model is often also called Spiral Dynamics. Don Beck, a student of Clare Graves, has awarded the new term. The term has become naturalised in many areas, especially as it is <a href="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/ken-wilber.html" title="Ken Wilber">Ken Wilber</a> often used.</p><br/>

<p>The Graves model particularly fascinates the Landsiedel team. Therefore, we have developed a test ourselves for this model. You can participate in this online free of charge and also receive an evaluation. In which area of the Graves model are you located? Find out.</p>
<p>In addition, we offer our own five-day special seminar with Rolf Lutterbeck, one of the leading spiral dynamics experts in the German language area.</p>
<p>For more information about the Graves model, see the e-book that Stephan Landsiedel wrote on this topic. You can download the e-book free of charge. </p>
<p>The Graves model and the approaches of Ken Wilber are also an integral part of our annual programme "Integrale Lebensführung".</p>
<h2>Maslow's need pyramid</h2>
<p>Abraham Maslow's need pyramid was the most famous model for the ontogenetic development of a human being in the 1930s. However, his theory was unfounded and gave Clare Graves - a contemporary Maslows - occasion to criticism.</p>
<div align="center">
<picture><source srcset="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/images/009-beduerfnispyramide.webp" type="image/webp"/>
<img alt="need pyramid" class="b-lazy" height="250" src="https://www.landsiedel-seminare.de/nlp-bibliothek/nlp-master/images/009-beduerfnispyramide.jpg" title="need pyramid" width="456"/></picture></div>
<p>In his opinion, Maslow's view of the self-updating person was too inflexible. He did not accept the endpoint of the Maslow pyramid as the endpoint of development, because Graves considered that certain value systems (=means) have developed in response to certain human conditions of existence. Such memes are, on the one hand, psychological attempts to react appropriately to certain historical conditions of existence and, on the other hand, these counter-movements to the respective prevailing system of values (antithetics).</p>
<h2>Graves Levels</h2>
<p><b> 1. Person Clare W. Graves</b><br/><br/>
Clare W. Graves (1914-1986) was American psychologist at Union College in New York and with his Meme model the Vordenker der Spiral Dynamics. The impulse for the development of this model was the central issue of his students: Why are people different? Why do some change? Why do some understand such completely different things as the highest human development goal of self-realization?<br/><br/> 
Grave's answer was: "In short, I say that the psychology of mature human beings is an evolving, oscillating, spiral-shaped process, emerging from previous stages, characterized by the subordination of older behavioral systems with lower rank, which progresses to newer higher systems above them when the existential problems of mankind change."<br/><br/> 
This means that human development is continuous and never finished. It changes with the change in human living conditions and thus creates new systems in which the old systems are integrated. When a new system or a new stage develops, we also change our psychology and our habits to adapt to these new conditions. The most diverse forms of life in this potentially open value system are possible. There is no final stage that everyone has to reach. The individual, companies or even entire societies can only react positively to management principles, motivational incentives, educational principles and permitted or ethical ideas that correspond to the current stage of this human existence!<br/><br/>

<h2>Graves Value Model:</h2>
<p>The emergent, cyclic double helix model of mature, adult biopsychosocial behavior</p>
<h3>Short description</h3>
<p>Each class of problems or Challenges are solved by creating a value system. Until now, mankind has produced eight different value systems: such value systems are mechanisms that the psyche has developed in order to be able to deal appropriately with certain environmental situations. If the problems and challenges facing a person or society change, then their value system also changes. Value systems are therefore appropriate if they enable a congruent problem solution behavior. However, they must not be compared independently of the context.<br/><br/> 
emergent = arising<br/>
Value systems are created by changing the environment again and again</p>
<h3>Cyclic double helix</h3>
<p>Each value system is created at the intersection of two forces, namely the problem and the respective problem solution approach.<br/><br/> 
A value system reflects how people think, i.e. their values and belief structures. However, they must not be confused with the subject or the respective content of thinking. Value systems are rather a scheme or a way of thinking. Frequently, value systems that are diametrically opposed in terms of content are, e.g. a fundamentalist religion and the so-called "atheistic communism", merely forms one and the same system of values.<br/><br/>  
The Graves model has an enormous explanation and prediction value and is applicable to all aspects of biological, psychological and sociological behavior. It explains both individual behavior and international political interactions: different thinking about religion, the sense of human existence, economics, politics, family, education, health and leisure, as well as different patterns of goals, ethics, motivation, lifestyle and organization. The entering or leaving of the respective system is triggered by forces from the environment in which the respective system exists. The depth structures of the Graves model however correspond to types of thinking, not types of people. These patterns form biopsychosocial systems and are neither a typology of people nor discrete evolutions of people. They reflect systems in the repertoire of human behavior, which is why every person has certain mental patterns that can be activated by different contexts and situations.</p>
<h3>The properties of the planes</h3>
<p>The emergent cyclic double helix model for the biopsychosocial development of adults postulates eight levels:</p>
<ul class="ul-content1"><li><b>Beige:</b> reactive, autistic, archaic and instinctive; the survival and survival struggle are the main focus</li>
<li><b>Violet</b> animistic, tribalistic, safety-oriented. The person sacrifices their own wishes for the tribe, the chief or the spirits</li>
<li><b>Red</b> egocentric, self-oriented, hedonistic, magical. The self wants to express itself here and now and does not care for others</li>
<li><b>Blue</b> absoluteistic, compliant, religious. The self sacrifices for later wages (in heaven, etc.)</li>
<li><b>Orange</b>  erfolgsorientiert, materialistisch, objektivistisch. Das Selbst kalkuliert die eigenen Interessen, um nicht in Konflikt mit anderen zu geraten</li>
<li><b>Green</b> Personalistic, group-oriented, humanistic. The self is ready to sacrifice itself for others </li>
<li><b>Yellow</b> Systemic, existential, functional. The self is interested in the current self-expression, but not at the expense of others</li>
<li><b>Turquoise</b> experience-oriented, global thinking, synergistic. The self is now ready to sacrifice itself so that life can continue.</li></ul>
<h2>The problems of the levels</h2>
<p>Each level of the Graves model represents a solution strategy and a response to a class of problems. Therefore, each level can be a connection between a group of problems or Challenges that people think about to cope with the problems.</p>
<table class="table3">
<thead><tr><th scope="col"><b>Symbolism</b></th><th scope="col"><b>Importance</b></th></tr></thead>

Only an awareness of a higher order and a transpersonal search for global solutions will ban the danger of destruction.</td></tr></table>
<h2>Level 1: reactive, automatic meme</h2>
<p>Small groups and bands that are mainly concerned with biological survival. At this level of development, the whole energy is aimed at survival. People of this stage live only in the present. In prenatal cultures there was this “animal” way of life, today they are found in children, mentally handicapped or senile people, in some cases also in drug addicts. However, this condition can also be caused by extreme stress and life-threatening situations.</p>
<h3>"Experience at any price"</h3>
<p><b>Start:</b><br/>
100,000 years ago<br/><br/>
<b>Maxime:</b><br/>
Self-expression with the aim of survival<br/><br/>
<b>Perspective:</b><br/>
The world is indefinite and vague, based on biological imperatives. Life is instinctive and is to subordinate itself to the will of nature without resistance<br/><br/>
<b>Living objective:</b><br/>
Immediate satisfaction of the periodically occurring physiological needs (food, drinking, security) to ensure survival of the species.<br/><br/>
<b>Solution strategies:</b><br/>
Reacts on environmental changes with the aim of survival. Changes and moves quickly and automatically in dependence on the changed resources and vitalities. Depends on life-supporting systems with minimal awareness about themselves and others. Small social groups work together to collect or chase foods to avoid dangers and reproduce. The behavior is mainly based on the stimulus repository model with the instinct as a key to survival.</p>
<h3>Forms of expression</h3>

<h2>Level 2: tribalistic, animistic meme</h2>
<p>The energy in self-sacrification is directed to the survival of the tribe, the attention lies on the present and past. People are dependent on the chief or clans or trunk. Such a way of thinking dominated most of the prescribing cultures and can still be found in clubs, narrow family units, sports teams today. But also in some parts of Africa, South America, Oceania and the Arctic, this stage is emerging.</p>

<b>Learning style:</b><br/>
Reflexively, i.e. a paternalist teacher, conditiones the desired responses to certain sensory inputs; need-oriented learning: the learner copies behaviour patterns from others; procedural (step by step), process-oriented, linear sequences; Rituals and rites structure everyday life and thus support memory as well as automated behavior. Use of magic/ imagination, symbols, drawings, as most illiterate are. Repetitive music supports long-term memory by using songs and smells as anchors.<br/><br/>
<b>Communication:</b><br/>
Information is only forwarded via the clanse, printed words are perceived as unreliable.<br/><br/>

<h2>Level 4: absolute, holy meme</h2>
<p>In the Graves model, this level is primarily compliant:<br/> 
The typical American middle class lives, for example, in this value system. Current needs are sacrificed to receive future rewards: At this stage, for the first time, the idea of driving for future rewards is created. The supreme commandments are obedience, punishment and maintenance of systems and constitute a necessary step in the formation of an orderly and progressive society among developing nations. In pure cultures we can find this type in doctrinal religions, absoluteist philosophical and political systems. Especially striking also in military and religious hierarchies.</p>

<b>Living objective:</b><br/>
Close peace with its interior and the belief that people need each other; the exploitation of man by man should be terminated, the consumer terror and the regulation of man should be overcome. Furthermore, hunger in the world is to be terminated, racism, oppression of women, social alienation etc., it is necessary to overcome.</p>

<p><b>Appearance form:</b><br/>
At the end of the 1960s, the early 1970s (anti-vietnam movement, hippi movement) the civil rights movement and the human-potential doctorate were created. Such an attitude occurs particularly in helping occupations (social workers, teachers) especially in Scandinavia and is becoming increasingly important in Japan, Germany and Switzerland.

<b>Perspective:</b><br/>

Die Welt ist in Gefahr unterzugehen, durch Ausbeutung der Natur und der Menschen. Diese Gesellschaft sieht das Leben als etwas vielgestaltiges, paradoxes, mehrdeutig polykontextuales, in dem die Balance zwischen Mensch und Natur wieder gefunden werden muss.<br/><br/>
<b>Living objective:</b><br/>
People should be regained with nature and take on world problems. Despite a world characterized by rapid change, it should be lived and traded as functionally as possible.<br/><br/>
<b>Solution strategies:</b><br/>
The relationship of man with the world must be questioned to ensure survival. The theory of autopoetic systems, self-regulation etc. forms the theoretical background for solution strategies.<br/><br/>
<b>Characteristic characteristics:</b><br/>
People at this level of development strive to improve their performance without being ambitious. They compare themselves with themselves as a person in the past or in the future (I-Ideal). Competence, reasons, reason and need count for such individuals, authority is rejected as well as age, status, dogmas or group membership.<br/>
The results of their work are satisfactory, but they may not be praised or highlighted excessively. They fight for their rights without constantly looking out for enemies in their surroundings. These people are free from internal constraints and can enjoy life, their focus is on flexibility, individual competence, self-motivation and tolerance for paradoxa.

<li><b>Up:</b> Acceptance of various experiences and emphasis on the functionality and the quality of "being" are the first.</li></ul>
<p><b>Learning style:</b><br/>
Informational learning in all representation systems is possible. Access to learning materials and knowledge should be self-determined and adapted to your own learning pace. The learning objectives are often unspecific and the development of the individual runs without constraints and without fear. Competition and addiction are not present, learners instead use what is present and work in unprestructured environments with as much control over their own time as possible.<br/><br/>
<b>Learning incentives:</b><br/>
Learning objectives are set themselves, as well as rewards are generated by the learner himself and not from the outside.<br/><br/>
<b>Example:</b><br/>
You see that the world is in danger of falling under a huge ecological or military collapse. The reason for this is that human and natural resources are abused. You want to get people in touch with nature again. You want to constantly improve your own performance. Knowledge and competence should be superior to rank, power and status. The greatness of existence is much more important to you than material possessions. You are flexible and able to accept different experiences at the same time. Only internal motivators count for you. You write books to save the world from the collapse. You recognize systemic relationships and point out.<br/><br/>

This learning form can take place in any way, but not new "learning toys" are introduced here, but other important aspects of the learning system are improved, such as e.g. the relative dissolution of fear in the learning process, which makes it possible to learn more quickly and effectively. The exchange with people living in other states of consciousness is sought. Learning is primarily an interaction with world-wide networks, through which people's perception and consciousness can expand. The various methods of thinking and procedures are tested, learning becomes a new form of being in connection with a collegial group of fellow citizens who can be scattered around the world. Thinking is intuitive and transrational or is made possible by holistic-synergetic processing of sensory input, by affective feedback and meta-processing.<br/><br/>
<b>Learning incentives:</b><br/>
Life is learning.<br/><br/>
<b>Example:</b><br/>
You are one of the leading minds on this planet in terms of the development of consciousness. You're going to find out the wholeness of everything. The world is for you a single, dynamic organism with its own collective spirit. Everything is connected to everything. Energy and information determine what is happening on Earth. You think holistic and intuitive. You are willing to sacrifice yourself and others to whom it is necessary for global survival. You are a thinker who finds and implements meta solutions to ensure the survival of the species beyond conventional geopolitical and economic boundaries. In addition, it is about avoiding war and overcoming poverty, hunger, disease as such, political oppression (Dalai Lama, Ken Wilber, Rupert Sheldrake).<br/><br/>

<h2>The Memes in the model of Spiral Dynamics</h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br/><br/>
The students of Clare Graves have expanded their model and created the Spiral Dynamics - one of the most precise models of cultural development. But Spiral Dynamics does not have a one-dimensional perspective and does not consider people with a cold analytical distance, but provides a clear, deep insight into the flowing patterns of human psyche. Perceptions and values are often unconsciously guided by our decisions or form our identity.<br/><br/>
Personal experiences are placed in a historical context of our human development, which leads to a liberating objectivity. This development is part of every human being and extends from the most primitive survival instinct (beige) to spiritual aspirations (turquoise). Spiral Dynamics is designed as a spiral, as it is an expression of natural and cosmic forces that can be detected in all: The spiral shape is found in our DNA, in our galaxies, etc...<br/>
The spiral with its upwardly expanding structure best describes the evolution of human consciousness as it corresponds to the unfolding way of thinking and the steadily growing complexity. But this development begins only 100,000 years ago as a "first-tier level" (=first stage/ rank? Memes 1-6) with the need to survive. The "Second-Tier-Level" (Memes 7-8) represents the "being level".</p>

<h2>Don Beck and his theory</h2>
<p>The "Spiral-Zauberer" Don Beck uses its model to change large systems within and between the different sectors or Cultures of the world community. For such large-scale interventions and transformations he created a new initiative called "Spiral Dynamics integral" (SDi). This is intended to enable a human transformation and global reconciliation. Until then, however, there is still another way, because according to the concept of the Spiral Dynamics, the nature of man is not invariable:<br/><br/> 
People can create new worlds, i.e. they can adapt to situations by creating a more complex way to solve problems. To this end, adaptable context-dependent intelligence is necessary, which can react to different living conditions. For Don Beck et al., the causal dynamic forces created by living conditions are always at the focus of attention as well as the coping mechanisms and collective intelligence.<br/><br/> 
In the concept of the Spiral Dynamics, these collective intelligences are called Memes: Memes (value systems) react like genes, viruses and bacteria to the same elementary principle of the universe, the concept of regeneration. Each subsequent Meme receives a further more complex organizational principle with special priorities, mentalities and specific principles. This is a method of problem-solving that focuses on what is most important - depending on the reaction to living conditions.<br/><br/>
Similar to the replicating DNA code is a meme code of bio-psycho-social and spiritual blueprint, which spreads throughout the culture and shows itself in all areas of cultural expression. It forms the survival code, the myths of origin, artistic forms of design, lifestyles and common sense. The shift to the next higher level of human development is triggered by crises and conflicts, but the spiral will never reach a final stage, but will continuously and dynamically expand upwards. According to Ken Wilber, every new social level transcends all previous ones, but also includes them. Therefore, the more complex thinking systems also have a higher degree of freedom.<br/><br/> 
However, until the yellow and the turquoise code are reached, there is still a lot of time since Memes are not people but adaptive intelligence in humans. However, various fragments or components already exist now, which is why the exchange and formation of a "syndicate of creative minds" are important.</p>

<h2>Development of NLP to Graves</h2>
<p>Within 30 years <a href="/en/was-ist-nlp.html" title="What is NLP?">NLP</a> from the engraving stage 4 to stage 7. The first generation of NLPs (1972) was a sign of the development of simple steps and techniques.<br/><br/>
The blue value system "create order" (level 4 in the Graves model) most probably describes this phase. Since 1980, the orange Meme developed, whose idea of success was enormous seminars with fire, strong media presence and persuasion. Parallel to the 5th Meme, the 6th engraving stage (green) was created in the form of a sensitive community with seminars where the focus is on the Wir-feeling, the group dynamics and the game.<br/><br/> 
At the beginning of the 1990s, the fourth generation developed on the yellow 7th value system "Integral and His Motivation": Professional NLP trainings with new seriosity, ethics and transforming topics. These include visionary leadership, tools of the spirit and core transformation. The aim of this stage is to provide a good integration of all the steps ahead, to increase the freedom of choice and flexibility of people, to develop their own potential at the level of being motivation and to give space for questions about the sense of life and the creation of wisdom.<br/><br/>
The stages of development of mankind can thus be found in different stages of development among NLP providers:<br/><br/>

Progress brings the possibilities for material prosperity.<br/><br/>
<b>"Success is everything!"<br/></b><br/>
It is worth doing profitable business as a self-employed person: capitalism, control, possess, manipulate, acquire knowledge, act independently giant seminars with fire and media rhymes<br/><br/>
<b>6. Level:</b><br/><br/>
Material social development makes it possible to ask the question of meaning.<br/><br/>
<b>"Sensitive Community"</b><br/><br/>
Communities allow the sense of life and the experience of personal growth: sensitiv, consensual, harmonious, equality, team development</p>
<h3>Paradigm shift from lack motivation to being motivation</h3>
<p><b>7. Level:</b><br/><br/>
The prosperity allows completely new thoughts, hopes and breakthrough experiences. Internet age.<br/><br/>
<b>"integral, wisdom, ethics, motivation of being"</b><br/><br/>
It makes sense to efficiently and effectively solve existing problems from new perspectives and to experience a flow feeling: delphinically, integration of professional NLP training with transforming topics<br/><br/>
<b>8. Level:</b><br/><br/>
The earth is facing a collapse. There is a danger that people will destroy them.<br/><br/>
Only an awareness of a higher order and a transpersonal search for global solutions will ban the danger of destruction: Transpersonal</p>
<h2>Application of Graves Value Model</h2>
<h3>1. In the clarification of conflicts (quoted according to O.p.a.l.)</h3>
<p>As a mixture of the steps blue, orange and green can normally be found in large companies, conflicts are pre-programmed.<br/><br/> 
Example:<br/>
The "oranges" reject the "blues" because they block changes from their point of view and they reject the "greens" because they always want to integrate all opinions and therefore discuss endlessly. The "greens" do not like the heartless, geld "oranges" and distrust the "blues" with their hierarchies and defined structures.<br/><br/> 
Let's fill the example with a little more life:<br/><br/>
Personnel departments are often "green" and are committed to the welfare of employees (e.g. by personnel development, employee incentives). Management is often "orange". For them, the performance of the employees is at first place. For this reason, some managers consider staff development as a waste of time. The "greens" evaluate the "oranges" and the "oranges" do not understand the "greens".<br/><br/> 
Can you explain conflicts in your company?<br/>
What are your hypotheses?<br/>
The problem is that every person and every company considers its own level to be the only right one and attacks the others. At our current level, we also evaluate our old stages of development that we have already left behind. We have evolved and now feel ourselves raised by people of the lower levels. We cannot understand the thinking of people of the upper stages of development.<br/>
Only from the stage yellow (7 in the Graves model) we have an integral view. From this level we value people at all levels.<br/></p>
<h3>Two. When used for employee management</h3>
<p><b>2.1 Problematik in Unternehmen</b><br/><br/>
A person, a company or even an entire nation can only react positively to the management principles, motivation incentives, educational principles and ethical values that correspond to their own development stage.<br/> 
This means that the individual development stages require different leadership and communication styles as well as procedures. For example, you can motivate "Blue" employees with a title or status symbol. Meanwhile, "orange" employees can be impressed with a performance-oriented premium. These incentives would be ineffective for "green" employees. Here teamwork is more promising in a "valuable" project.<br/><br/> 
However, our development stage is not static, but it changes. Every person/system develops upwards in the long term with increasing complexity of the environment. If we have adopted a new stage of development, we will change our view of the world, our way of thinking and habits of living to adapt to the new conditions. In future, we will be carrying out the ongoing stages of development. This is the same for a developing system.<br/><br/> 
However, a person/system can fall back to a lower level in crises. For example, in the case of recession and unemployment, social thinking (level green) can first go back and hard competition (level orange or red) can arise. If we have successfully mastered the crisis, we take the place on our "old" stage of development relatively quickly.<br/>
What is the result of the knowledge of the different stages of development for everyday working life?</p>
<h2>Exercises for Graves Model</h2>
<p>Why don't you remember a situation with an employee, a colleague or a pre-legislator who was a little tense and conflict-loaded? Select a person you suspect to be on another stage of development.<br/><br/>
Note the following points:</p>
<ul class="ul-content1"><li>Every person evaluates things differently because he thinks differently. People therefore think differently because they have other brains!</li>
<li>Different organizations take different positions on the "Psychological Map", and it is therefore important for them to develop different management strategies that match their employees and their areas of activity. Managers should keep a consistent and systematic approach, so that all parts are "connected".</li>
<li>In this way, the personnel search is started correctly, the selection as well as the placement or the training of employees up to management of staff and marketing form a unit. In addition, organisations should organize their management system from below to above to be able to respond adequately to the employees. However, these changes, move on to the "Psychological Map"!</li>
<li>Marketing strategies often fail as they are a mirror image of the designer. They correspond to their own system of values, but not necessarily to that of the audience which is to be achieved.</li>
<li>That is why not the question of how I can motivate people, but how I can relate my actions to their natural flow of motivation.</li>
<li>The current productivity problem is a sign of growth and culture and not a sign of its decline. It is therefore necessary to find new ways of dealing with people based on what we have now become. Students, trainers and their teaching strategies must be coordinated.</li></ul>
